 There was pandemonium at Lugbe primary school, 009, Abuja on Saturday afternoon, February 25, after voters allegedly caught INEC officials thumb-printing ballot papers. Multiple sources report that they were kept waiting for hours as some INEC officials claimed the ballot papers weren’t available at the moment. A source said, “They kept us waiting for over three hours claiming there was no ballot paper only for some voters to see some of the officials in a classroom in the school, thumb-printing the ballot papers. The irate voters took over the classroom and be@t both the INEC staff and the youth corpers who were on election duty.”
