By Leymah R. Gbowee Some months ago, one of my daughters came to talk to me about her friends and how she feels sometimes. She said that every time her friends call on her with their issues, she runs to support them. However, when she has a problem and calls, every one of them has some excuse. I asked her if she had considered doing a “FRIENDS AUDIT.” She said, “What is that?” I told her it is an evaluation of all friendships. I listed four of my friends and explained the nature of each of those friendships and how they play out. Also read: Be self-controlled and contented I have a friend whom I call on when I need cheering up. Another friend never has a bad word to say about anyone, so when I am upset, I call her, and she will always say, “Leymah, you know we all have bad ways, so don’t take it too harshly.” One of my friends is so affectionate and finds every reason to spoil me with things and love. Doing a Friends Audit allows one to enjoy people’s company without expecting more than they have to offer you. Some people can only take a teaspoon of love and give a teaspoon in return. Others may pour out hundreds of gallons of affection and only require a teaspoon.

It would help restore your joy and keep many friendships alive.
