President Muhammadu Buhari has arrived Lafia, Nasarawa State, to inaugurate Federal Government projects including the Agricultural Machinery and Equipment Development Institute (AMEDI) in Lafia. The AMEDI is one of the Buhari administration’s legacies meant to make Nigeria a hub and supplier of agro-allied technology, equipment and machinery. The project is as also aimed at making the nation self-sufficient in food production as well as creating more sustainable jobs for Nigeria’s teeming youths. AMEDI, a multi-billion Naira product of National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure (NASENI), is equipped with modern laboratories and machines for mechanised farming and agricultural development in the country. The Executive Vice Chairman/Chief Executive of NASENI, Prof. Muhammed Haruna, expressed optimism that AMEDI would assist Federal Government’s plans to promote food security in the country. According to Haruna, similar centres will soon be inaugurated within the lifetime of the Buhari administration across the country. The President is also expected to inaugurate the newly constructed Federal Secretariat, Lafia, and visit the Emir’s Palace in Lafia before attending the campaign rally of the All Progressives Congress (APC) at the Lafia Stadium. The President is expected back in Abuja immediately after the political rally where the presidential, gubernatorial and other candidates of the APC would be presented to electorate by the president.
