  The operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) have arrested the convicted senator representing Delta North District, Peter Nwaoboshi, in a hospital in Lagos. The Court of Appeal, Lagos, sentenced the lawmaker to seven years in prison for money laundering to the tune of N805 million in July last year. The commission arraigned Nwaoboshi alongside two companies – Golden Touch Construction Project Limited and Suiming Electrical Limited on a two-count charge of money laundering and fraud on April 25, 2018.

The statement read: “The Senator representing Delta North in the National Assembly, Peter Nwaoboshi, who has been on the run for months after the Court of Appeal, Lagos Division, convicted and sentenced him to 7 years imprisonment for money laundering, is finally in prison custody. “The lawmaker who was intercepted by operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, EFCC, at a Hospital in Lagos on Monday, February 6, was finally remanded in Ikoyi Custodial Centre today, February 8, 2023, to commence his prison term.”
