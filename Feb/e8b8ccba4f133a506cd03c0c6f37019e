They say a mother and a daughter is one of the closest relationships in the world. Losing that relationship taught me how capable I was of loving, losing, and feeling pain. “Losing you has given me purpose. I will continue to live every day for you. I will be the best version of myself. I will make you proud. With every choice, every decision, and every step I take for the rest of my life, I will honor you. 19 years without you is hard, and it probably always will be, but I will live this life for you momma. “Continue to rest on ALHAJA. I miss you dearly as I type this in tears.”
