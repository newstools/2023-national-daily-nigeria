The Supreme Court of Nigeria on Wednesday delivered judgment on the lingering crisis in the Peoples Democratic party (PDP) in Edo State. The Supreme Court in the judgment, dismissing the appeal, stated that the “…issue for determination formulated by Ferdinand Orbih for the Appellants does not flow from the decision of the lower court.” The Supreme Court, accordingly, dismissed the appeal for lacking in merit. The Supreme Court, in a unanimous judgment, held that it lacked jurisdiction to dabble in the internal affairs of a political party and, thus, dismissed the appeal lodged by the Dan Orbih faction of the PDP. Justice Emmanuel Agim, delivering the lead judgment, upheld the judgment of the Court of Appeal which held that the subject matter of the appeal was an internal affair of the party and, therefore, falls outside the jurisdiction of the court. Members of the Edo State PDP Legacy Group, led by PDP National Vice Chairman, South-South, Dan Orbih, including Senator, Mathew Urhoghide, representing Edo South Senatorial District, have been at loggerhead with the PDP faction led by Governor Godwin Obaseki over the control of the party in the state. Other members of the group include Edo State PDP Vice Chairman, Henry Omagbon; Engr Ogbeide-Ihama, House of Representatives member, representing Oredo Federal Constituency; Pascal Ugbome, Barr Lucy Omagbon, Engr Mike Onolemenmen, Larry Okunbor and Ogieva Okunbor. The judgement had ended the rift, claims and counter-claims in the Edo PDP.
