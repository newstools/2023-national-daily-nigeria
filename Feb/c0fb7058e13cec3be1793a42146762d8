 The trial of former Deputy Senate President, Senator Ike Ekweremadu, continued on Tuesday at the Old Bailey court in Central England, the UK, where he is standing trial over an alleged plot to harvest the kidney of a 22-year-old street trader, David Ukpo. The alleged victim told the court that he had slept on the streets for 3 days after doctors at a London hospital told him he would not be a suitable donor following preliminary tests. He then walked into a police station last May & said he was “looking for someone to save my life”, the court heard. In body-worn footage shown to jurors, the trafficked victim appeared to be crying & distressed when he walked into the police station. He told jurors he thought he was coming to the UK to work & only realized it was for a kidney transplant. The young man was “shocked”, felt like crying, & told jurors, “Nobody told me about kidney transplant.”
