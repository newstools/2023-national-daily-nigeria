    National Daily can confirm that Chelsea have spent big since Todd Boehly’s takeover especially with their £320m spent in January outstripping the £280m of last summer. It is understood that the Blues are set to battle Liverpool and Manchester City for the signature of Dortmund superstar Jude Bellingham this summer, despite their huge £600m outlay over the last two windows. And with the club already walking a Financial Fair Play tightrope, they will however hope to sell off the likes of Romelu Lukaku, Mateo Kovacic, Hakim Ziyech and Christian Pulisic to raise some necessary funds. Boehly however is aware that Chelsea will need more quality throughout the squad to fulfill their desire of returning to the top of the Premier League. Meanwhile, England international, Bellingham, is set to be the biggest mover in this summer’s transfer window with the likes of Liverpool, City and Real Madrid already laying down the groundwork to sign the 20-year-old.
