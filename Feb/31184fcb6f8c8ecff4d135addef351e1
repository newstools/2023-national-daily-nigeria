  National Daily understands that the UK government has announced plans for an independent football regulator in a bid to block English clubs from breaking away to form a European Super League. It will be recalled that the Premier League ‘big six’’; Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Chelsea, Manchester City and Tottenham had tried to abandon English football in 2021 which led to widespread condemnation and fan protests as they eventually backed down over plans for a closed-shop competition with owners forced to apologise. It led to a fan-led review into English football to prevent the events reoccurring, to ensure that owners run clubs appropriately and to resolve issues around how money flows down to the lower leagues and grassroots – among other issues – such as avoiding repeats of recent financial failings seen at clubs like Bury FC. National Daily gathered that the aim of the independent football regulator is to protect English football’s cultural heritage and the government will now push forward and publish its White Paper which outlines the legislation on the sport’s governance on Thursday.
