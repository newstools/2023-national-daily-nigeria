The presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), former Vice Atiku Abubakar, on Saturday defeated the candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, Â and the Labour Party (LP) candidate, Peter Obi, in the polling unit of Governor Aminu Waziri Tambuwal of Sokoto State, the Director General of the Atiku-Okowa Presidential Campaign Council, and PDP candidate for Sokoto-South Senatorial District. Provisional result announced at the polling unit 033, at the Government Girls Day Secondary School, Tambuwal, indicated that Atiku had 250 votes, Tinubu had 44 votes, while Obi trailed behind. The results of the Senatorial and House of Representatives elections showed that the PDP had 252 for senate; and 247 votes for Reps, while APC had 45 for senate; and 48 for Reps. The various candidates are taking advantage of their respective strongholds. Obi on Saturday threw a strong challenge to Tinubu in Lagos. However, until the holistic result is compiled in the state, the trend of events can seldom be predetermined.
