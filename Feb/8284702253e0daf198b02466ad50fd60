The former Executive Secretary of the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS), Professor Usman Yusuf, on Monday said that no governor of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the North can deliver any state for the APC presidential candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, in the 2023 general elections. Professor Yusuf, speaking on Channels Television on Monday, declared that “none of the APC governors in the North, has the goodwill of the people to deliver anything to him… None.” He maintained that Tinubu has been involved in regional politics in Lagos “where he is Alpha and Omega, nobody challenges him.” The former NHIS Executive Secretary noted that Tinubu has built people, but he has no experience of politics in the national front., saying, “his inexperience is showing”. Prof. Yusuf pointed out that Tinubu is not talking to the people in the North, saying that he is merely sub-contracting the presidential campaign to praise singers, and APC governors. According to Yusuf, “when it comes to the campaign hosting, he only dances and leaves.” Professor Yusuf was of the view that President Muhammadu Buhari has squandered all the influence and goodwill which he had internationally and nationally, adding that “as such, cannot see to birthing the dream of handing over to a candidate from the APC.” He declared that only the people’s wish will prevail in the 2023 elections.
