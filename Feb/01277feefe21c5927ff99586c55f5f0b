Nollywood actress, Empress Njamah, has regained access to her Instagram account after it was hacked by her ex-lover, George Wade. On her return, the actress revealed the trauma that she went through with her ex-lover on Thursday. Wade created a WhatsApp group where he added people and shared Njamah’s naked pictures and videos. The actress apologised to her fans and friends who were taken advantage of by her ex-lover. She wrote, “I was glad I came out to speak. Putting his picture out there has brought out so many of his victims. He is known with different names and has really done terrible things to so many women. It’s been his trade for years, to take everything they have without mercy and blackmail them with their nudes. His pictures (that) I put out have exposed a lot about him, the appropriate authorities are on it. He’s still on the run, the police are on it.

Video calls this blackmailer recorded which people dating do and videos taken from my house during my shower. Because of his evil intentions. I was able to escape and run for my life from his regular beating, threats, humiliation. (I practically lived in the hospital) because I exposed him, he then posted the videos thinking I was the same scared person. I overpowered him. Thank God, I am alive, free, getting my life back.”
