   Harry Kane departing Tottenham Hotspur has always enjoy a space in the media when it comes to transfer speculations. And speaking on the possibility of actualizing the dream, former Spurs hitman Dimitar Berbatov lends his voice. Speaking to Betfred, the Bulgarian questioned: ‘First of all, is it going to be another saga of Harry Kane being linked with a move somewhere and nothing happens?’. ‘This is something that’s happened in the last couple of transfer windows. Based on that, I don’t believe that a move will happen. ‘I think Harry Kane’s legacy at Tottenham is so big, especially with him becoming the greatest goalscorer in the club’s history, that a move to another team in the Premier League could tarnish that legacy he’s built and would make the fans angry as well. ‘A move a few years ago would have been a bit more acceptable in terms of his legacy at Spurs but now I don’t believe a move is going to materialise now. Harry becoming Tottenham’s all-time leading goalscorer is a great achievement and he fully deserves it.’ However, many have tipped the England forward to pursue a move to Old Trafford for a likely possibility of fulfilling his dreams of winning medals if by chance he decides to quit Tottenham.
