 Media personality, Uti Nwachukwu, has explained why men has no business getting married before the age of 40. Speaking in a recent interview with his colleague, Toke Makinwa, Uti said: “I might be Kamala Harris’ age when I decide to get married, I don’t know. Until you are ready. I don’t believe in monogamy when you’re young but there are exceptions to every rule. Do you understand? There are some people that monogamy would work for when they’re young but the average person, I’ve always said, I don’t think any man has any business marrying before 40.

For women, apart from those that are afraid of their biological clock, but then again, how many children do women want these days? And please there is technology these days too. I don’t think any woman should be married before 30. You have to experience life as a single. You have to weigh your options.
