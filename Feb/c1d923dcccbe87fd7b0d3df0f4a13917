He said no one in the value chain is clean when it comes to the challenges causing the fuel crisis. However, they are willing to tackle the issues and make fuel available at reasonable prices. Osatuyi went further to state that more depots will be made available so more products can come into the country. He also addressed the issue of cross-border smuggling. He said  the Nigeria Union of Petroleum and Natural Gas Workers needs to caution their members not to drive their fuel trucks across the borders into neighbouring countries.

According to him, NUPENG has to agree on how much marketers will pay for transportation costs as this will also determine how much will be added to the depot pricing. He also said when subsidies are removed, and refineries are working at full capacity, there will be no importation cost.
