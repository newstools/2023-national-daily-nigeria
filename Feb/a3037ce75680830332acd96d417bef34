  Banks in some parts of Lagos on Tuesday morning shut their doors against desperate customers seeking payment following the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) cash swap policy. In Town planning Lagos, a new generation bank shut its gates as early as 9 am to customers who couldnâ€™t carry out transactions too. At Obanikoro, two new generation banks also locked their gates against customers. Visibly angry customers gathered in front of the banks lamenting the development. Some of them accused the CBN and powerful government forces of plotting to frustrate the forthcoming general elections. A mild drama played out in one of the new generation banks on town planning when a man openly cried about inability to access cash.
