   Chieftain of the Labour Party, Prof. Pat Utomi, has raised the alarm over the refusal of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to upload polling unit results on its portal. Recall that National Daily had earlier reported that INEC’s server had been down with some voters in Alimosho area of Lagos complaining of sabotage. The result viewing portal of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has remained down with polling unit results still not uploaded.

INEC has not given any statement to allay the fears of Nigerians who have been making efforts to log into the portal. Reports also indicated that no polling unit result has been uploaded so far because the portal is inaccessible. Pat Utomi said the situation may lead to protest by youths if they suspect that their will is about to be truncated in the face of what he described as a Labour Party landslide. Utomi said: “Just spoke to Labour Party Chairman Abure who fears that the upload failure epidemic may be seen by the youth as an attempt to rig a clear Labour landslide across the country. He is scared that if they hit the streets Nigeria could burn. I urge Chairman Yakubu to redeem himself.”
