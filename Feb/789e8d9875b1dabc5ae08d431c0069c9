  This could definitely be an exciting news for fans at Old Trafford following Barcelona’s confirmation that Sergio Busquets has been sidelined with an ankle injury and expected to miss their Europa League tie against Manchester United. The Catalan giants extended their lead at the summit of La Liga to eight points on Sunday night with a 3-0 victory over Sevilla. Busquets was forced off inside 10 minutes, however, hobbling off the pitch with an ankle injury. National Daily gathered that Barcelona have now confirmed that their veteran midfielder has suffered a sprained ankle. A short statement from the club read: ‘Tests carried out this morning have revealed that Sergio Busquets has a lateral collateral ligament sprain in his left ankle. ‘He is out and his recovery will determine his availability.’ While Barcelona have not been a timeline on his return, SPORT report Busquets is likely to be out for two to three weeks. Xavi’s side host United in the first leg of their Europa League play-off on Thursday 16 February, with the return leg taking place at Old Trafford the following week. Busquets’ injury seems certain to rule to him out of that first meeting and could leave him a race to be fit in time for the game in Manchester. Barcelona are already without Ousmane Dembele for the first leg after the winger suffered a thigh muscle injury in the 1-9 win over Girona in late January. While Barcelona again did not put a specific timeline on his return, reports in Spain indicated the France international would be sideliend for three weeks. United meanwhile have seen some of their injury and fitness issues ease in recent weeks with Diogo Dalot back in training and with Anthony Martial and Jadon Sancho also making their returns to the side in the win over Nottingham Forest last week. However, Erik ten Hag will similarly be without Christian Eriksen until late April or early May as a result of the injury suffered in the FA Cup victory over Reading.
