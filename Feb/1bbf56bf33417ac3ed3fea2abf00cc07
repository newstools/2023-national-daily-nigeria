 José Luis Callisaya Diaz has been caught despite his attempt to disguise as a sheep to escape from prison. National Daily learnt that he had managed to albeit temporarily for a break out of the Chonchocoro prison in Bolivia where he is serving time for homicide. Diaz had donned a sheep-skin jacket in an attempt to ‘blend in’ as he crawled through nearby fields. The inmate had escaped and made it out onto the grassland on February 4. But, despite the attempt to blend in as a farm animal, Diaz was forced to turn back to his cell after authorities caught him red-handed. In a bizarre set of photos, José Luis can be seen on all fours wearing the jacket and dark trousers while appearing to trail through the grass, impersonating a sheep. Since the prison break, authorities have ordered legal and disciplinary actions against the prisoner. The director of the Penitentiary Regime, Juan Carlos Limpias said: ‘Prison security police officers from the San Pedro de Chonchocoro Penitentiary Center prevented the escape of prisoner José Luis Callisaya Diaz (alias El Araña), who took advantage of the inclement weather to try to escape through one of the walls of the prison external perimeter of the prison.’
