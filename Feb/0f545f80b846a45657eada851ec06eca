IPOB on Thursday, February 2, has suspended the weekly sit-at-home order ahead of the 2023 elections. Emma Powerful, the group’s spokesperson disclosed the information in a statement where he noted that the group had no interest in the presidential poll. “IPOB led by Mazi Nnamdi Kanu has never forcefully obstructed the election process in Nigeria. Rather, we once called Biafrans to boycott elections, which was later called off.

We knew that this mushroom group called PANPIEC is among those sponsoring this fake group claiming that they are IPOB issuing & enforcing reckless sit at homes in the east.
