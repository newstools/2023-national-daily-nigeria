  The Inspector-General of Police, IGP Usman Alkali Baba has launched the ‘IGP-SmartForce Database Management Centre’ today Wednesday 1st February, 2023, for Personnel Records Digitalization and Biometric Capturing of all officers of the Nigeria Police Force. The initiative is to ensure that all officers have their details captured and stored for record purposes and to ease administrative bottlenecks, create ease in tracking postings/transfers, and issue Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Cards for personnel identification. The SmartForce with Storage Servers domiciled in the Nigeria Police Force National Command and Control Centre (NPF-C4i) facilities and SmartForce office, Office of the Force Secretary in the Force Headquarters, Abuja, is aimed at integrating the Force into an ICT-Based System to simplify the management of its personnel records,  manage the entire workforce of the Nigeria Police Force, uniquely manage/identify each personnel of the Force and is structured with modern technological concepts to monitor the distribution of personnel workforce and access across the country.
