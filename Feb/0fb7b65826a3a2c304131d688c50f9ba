According to NCC, a subscriber who is dissatisfied with the services of his or her original service provider has the liberty to port to another network, while still retaining the original number. NCC however warned that a subscriber must remain on a particular network for at least 90 days after the initial porting, before such subscriber is allowed to return to its original network or port again to another network of choice.
