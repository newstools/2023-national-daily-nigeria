 The Supreme Court of Kenya has ruled that spouses are not entitled to a 50/50 share of matrimonial assets or property after divorce. Following the landmark ruling given by the five-man Supreme Court judges, couples are no longer automatically entitled to a 50 per cent share of property in case of a divorce.

This is opposed to the controversial traditional assumption that one was entitled to a 50 per cent share. The Court also stated that while Article 45(3) of the Constitution deals with equality of the fundamental rights of spouses during the dissolution of a marriage, such equality does not mean the re-distribution of proprietary rights or an assumption that spouses are automatically entitled to a 50 percent share by fact of being married.
