   Manchester United will look to progress from the play-off stages of the Europa League when they play host to Barcelona in the second leg on Thursday at Old Trafford. Meanwhile, the report reaching National Daily reveals that the Red Devils are sweating it to get some key players fit for the crucial clash with the likes of Anthony Martial, Harry Maguire and Antony coming as major doubts. United played out an entertaining 2-2 draw with the La Liga giants at the Camp Nou last Thursday and must beat the Spanish side at Old Trafford for the chance to progress to the last-16 of the competition. Erik ten Hag men continue to fight on four fronts, with the Carabao Cup final against Newcastle United slated for less than 72 hours after their clash against Barcelona. There is no doubt the schedule has stretched Erik ten Hag’s squad, particularly after long-term injuries to Christian Eriksen and Donny van de Beek. But there’s unlikely to be any good news in the short-term, with Martial, Maguire and Antony still absent from training ahead of Thursday’s game. National Daily gathered that Martial and Antony had both started light, individual training last week but they’re yet to reintegrate into first team training. Casemiro is available after serving the third of a three-match suspension against Leicester City on Sunday. Interestingly for Ten Hag, Marcel Sabitzer and Lisandro Martinez who both missed the first leg through suspension are available again for selection. Raphael Varane is also expected to return to their starting line-up, having remained on the bench for Sunday’s win against the Foxes.
