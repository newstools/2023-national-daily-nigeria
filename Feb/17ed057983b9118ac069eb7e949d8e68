 National Daily can confirm that Newcastle United star man Bruno Guimaraes will be available to face Man United in the Carabao Cup final, despite his red card against Southampton. The Brazilian who has been in sensational form for the Magpies this season was sent off in the 82nd minute after a nasty challenge on Sam Edozie, which was deemed a red card offence after a VAR review. The new revelation has elated fans at St. James Park who had initially feared he would be ruled out of the final after Eddie Howe’s side booked their spot in the final following their 2-1 victory against the Saints. The good news for the Magpies faithfuls is that Guimaraes will be available, as his three-match ban carries over to the Premier League. So, while the Brazilian will miss matches against West Ham, Bournemouth and Liverpool, he will be available to Face the Red Devils for the Wembley final after United’s 5-0 aggregate win over Nottingham Forest. Newcastle’s last final appearance also came against the Red Devils, in the 1999 FA Cup final.
