 The House of Assembly Candidates of the Social Democratic Party (SDP) from the six South West States has endorsed APC Presidential Candidate, Sen. Bola Tinubu and his running mate, Sen. Kashim Shettima in Saturday’s General Elections. Speaking at the endorsement ceremony in Lagos on Thursday, spokesman for the forum, Chief Olabode Olajide said the group took the step because of the track records of Tinubu. “We reached the decision sequence to our thorough analysis of all the presidential candidates including our own, their antecedents, pedigree, manifesto and broad acceptance across the country. “There is no doubt that Tinubu/ Shettima combination stand head and shoulder above the rest. “Our democratic history will be grossly incomplete if generous pages are not dedicated to Tinubu’s contribution to our democratic struggles and his landmark achievements as a former governor of Lagos state. “His consistency as a progressive democrat is worthy of emulation by all budding politicians,” Olajide, SDP Candidate for Ede North, Osun House of Assembly Candidate, said. According to him, the group observed Tinubu’s energetic campaign through the nooks and crannies of the country, and have decided to pull their weights behind Tinubu to lead the country out of the woods. “His message of Renewed Hope reverberated with all and sundry and we safely concluded that we have in Tinubu, a candidate who is ready to confront head long, the various problems bedeviling our nation. “A vote for Tinubu will indeed be a vote for a prepared presidency,” he said. Olajide urged all their supporters in various houses of assembly in the region to come out massively on Saturday to vote for Tinubu ‘to usher in the Nigeria of our dream.
