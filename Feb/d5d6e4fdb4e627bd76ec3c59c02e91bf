  Telecom services provider, MTN Nigeria Communications Plc, has apologised to its customers for the service breakdown they experienced on the network on Tuesday. The disruption prevented many customers of the company from making and receiving calls, even as data usage was also impossible for several hours. MTN, which is the largest mobile operator in Nigeria by subscriber number, admitted that it failed the subscribers and disrupted their plans for the special day as a result of the network issue which prevented users from communicating with their loved ones. The company, however, said the issue with its network has been resolved and services restored. Part of the apology issued by the telco on Tuesday night said: “Today, of all days, you couldn’t count on us to keep you seamlessly connected with the people, places, businesses, and things that matter to you. Words cannot express how sorry we are sorry for the disruption we caused. The issue has been resolved and services restored. You matter to us and we will never stop showing you how much.” READ ALSO: MTN, Airtel invest over N6bn to bring 4G, 5G networks to Nigerians Many MTN subscribers had decried the service outage on the network as they were completely cut off from communicating while the service breakdown lasted. The outage started around Tuesday afternoon and lasted until the evening before it was resolved. Earlier in the day the telecoms company in a message posted on Twitter said it was facing a technical issue and promised to fix the problem soon. “Dear customers due to an unexpected technical issue, some customers have difficulty using our services this time. Work is ongoing to resolve this issue as quickly as possible. We regret all inconveniences this may cause,” MTN wrote. Data from the Nigerian Communications Commission (NCC) shows that as of December 2022, MTN had a total of 89 million active subscriptions on its network, making it the largest telecom operator in Nigeria.
