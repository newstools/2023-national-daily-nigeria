  Former President Olusegun Obasanjo has accused the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) of compromising the 2023 general elections with the ways it handled the uploading of polling units to it’s server. Obasanjo in a statement on Monday said it is no secret that INEC officials, at operational level, have been allegedly compromised to make what should have worked not to work and to revert to manual transmission of results which is manipulated and the results doctored. “The Chairman of INEC may claim ignorance but he cannot fold his hands and do nothing when he knows that election process has been corrupted and most of the results that are brought outside BVAS and Server are not true reflection of the will of Nigerians who have made their individual choice.

If the Chairman can postpone elections four days to the election, he can do everything to rectify the errors of the last two days – no BVAS, no result to be acceptable; and no uploading through Server, no result to be acceptable.

Chairman INEC, I have thought that you would use this wonderful opportunity to mend your reputation and character for posterity. The former president advised President Muhammadu Buhari to do the right thing to avoid a major crisis in the country. “Tension is building up and please let all elections that do not pass the credibility and transparency test be cancelled and be brought back with areas where elections were disrupted for next Saturday, March 4, 2023, and BVAS and Server officials be changed. “To know which stations or polling units were manipulated, let a Committee of INEC staff and representatives of the four major political parties with the Chairman of Nigerian Bar Association look into what must be done to have hitch-free elections next Saturday. “Mr. President, may your plan and hope for leaving a legacy of free, fair, transparent and credible election be realised. Mr. President, please don’t let anybody say to you that it does not matter or it is the problem of INEC. On no account should you be seen as part of the collusion or compromise. When the die is cast, it will be your problem as the Chief Executive of the nation. The Chairman of INEC may sneak out of the country or go back to his ivory tower. Your Excellency, thank you for hearing me out. Obasnajo, however asvised Nigerians to exercise patience until the wrong is righted, adding that he strongly believed that nobody will toy with the future and fortune of Nigeria at this juncture.
