One of the other major parties in the state and its presidential candidate was blamed for the attacks. An activist and Obi supporter, Rinu Oduala, said, “‘Obidients are bullies’. But one party is currently trying to prevent LP rally in Lagos by sponsoring attacks with thugs armed with machetes and guns. The wickedness of our ‘intellectuals and celebrities’ isn’t talked about enough.” “They just did at Jakande but we were able to get them to TBS, They are receiving treatment. Please signal us if you experience any difficulties. “Just look at the way thugs are attacking innocent folks and their cars/buses because of their support for a better Nigeria. Well, nothing good comes easy. We are too close to give up now Nigeria must be great,” he tweeted.
