Nigerian Police has commended the effort of a popular blog, Gistlover, for exposing the extrajudicial killings and corruption of some police officers at the Zone 13 Command, Ukpo-Dunukofia, and the Anambra State Command. The blog published a detailed report alleging that CSP Patrick Agbazue, a senior police officer in Anambra, and his team are involved in citizen kidnapping, torture, and murder. The Force Public Relations Officer, Olumuyiwa Adejobi, in a post shared via his Twitter handle on Saturday applauded the blogger’s effort and urged the blogger to relate with him on the case if he or she does not want to connect with the team due to the journalism style of the blog. He wrote, “ Good day. We really want to appreciate Nigerians, most especially #Gistloversblog, for the efforts put together to call out attention to the allegations and incidences in Anambra.

I can confirm to you for free that the IGP has personally waded into the matter, set up a strong panel to investigate the case, and report within 2 wks. “ The team will demand more credible evidence to guide their investigation and report. Pls, be free to assist and relate with the officers In particular, #Gistloversblog1 is urged to relate with me if he/she doesn’t want to relate with the team because of his or her style of journalism. “ While the investigation lasts, we will take some steps to sanitise the RRS office in ANS and other similar outfits alike. We want to assure you all that diligent investigation will be done by the guru panel. Be assured that we will be updating you on a regular basis. Thanks for keeping watch on us, and we hope we have that Police Institution we all deserve in Nigeria. Ire o.”
