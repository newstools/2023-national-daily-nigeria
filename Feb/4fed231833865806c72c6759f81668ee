  The All Progressives Congress (APC) has declared its support for the governors on their position regarding the naira redesign. At least 10 states had approached the Supreme Court to set aside President Muhammadu Buhari’s directive on the naira swap. The states are Lagos, Kaduna, Kogi, Zamfara, Ondo, Ekiti, Katsina, Ogun, Cross River, and Sokoto. The president had in a nationwide broadcast on Thursday extended the validity of the old N200 notes till April 10.

Following President Buhari’s directive, the Kaduna State Governor, Nasir El-Rufai, and his colleagues in Kano, Kogi, and Jigawa rejected the move and insisted that all the naira notes remain legal tender until the Supreme Court determines otherwise. The APC National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, disclosed this to journalists at the end of a meeting with the governors at the party’s National Secretariat in Abuja. He said the party would align with its governors’ position on the naira redesign.
