  The Federal Government has directed depot operators to sell Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) also known as petrol at the official price of N172 per litre to independent marketers. This followed the supply of over 150 million litres of petrol to the Ijegun tank farm in Lagos State. This supply accounts for up to 35 percent of national consumption volume and will go a long way in addressing the current fuel scarcity in the country. The officials of the Nigerian Midstream and Downstream Petroleum Regulatory Authority (NMDPRA) gave this directive during a visit to the tank farm on Friday. They assured Nigerians that the independent marketers under the aegis of the Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) would now get petrol at the ex-depot price of N172 per litre like the major marketers.
