Singer, Tems, has won her first ever Grammys at the 2023 edition of the annual award show. Tems got on the winners’ list on Sunday night for her feature in the 2022 hit song by Future, ‘Wait for U’, which also included Drake. While Tems won in the ‘Best Melodic Rap Performance’ category, her colleague, Burna Boy failed to win in his categories. He had been nominated in the ‘Best Global Music Album’ and the ‘Best Global Music Performance’ categories. South Africa’s Wouter Kellerman, Zakes Bantwini & Nomcebo Zikode defeated Burna Boy’s Last Last to claim the award for the Best Global Music performance while Japan’s Masa Takumi edged his album, ‘Love Damini’ to win the Best Global Album category.
