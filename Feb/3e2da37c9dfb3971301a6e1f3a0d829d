 The Commissioner of Police in Ogun State, CP Frank Mba, at the weekend commended residents of the State for their resilience and peaceful conduct, in the face of the biting challenges, resulting from the new Naira policy and paucity of fuel supply in the State. The CP made this known during a confidence-building patrol conducted by the Police and other security forces in the State, on Saturday, targeted at assuring residents of the resolve of the Command to protect lives and property, prevent breakdown of law and order, and improve public safety and security. CP Mba, however, noted that intelligence at the disposal of the Command indicated that some criminal elements are planning to take advantage of the challenging economic situation to disrupt the peace being enjoyed in the State. He, therefore, cautioned that the Police will not fold their arms and allow persons with criminal intentions to hide under any guise whatsoever, to unleash mayhem on residents, private and public property, and critical national infrastructure, including banks and offices of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC).
