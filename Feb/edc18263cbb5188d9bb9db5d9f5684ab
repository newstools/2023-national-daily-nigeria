   National Daily can confirm that Arsenal new signing Jakub Kiwior has already broken three records in his first training sessions with Arsenal. Kiwior who was brought in on a deal worth £20 million to provide immediate back up for William Saliba and Gabriel Magalhaes. The pair have formed a solid partnership at the heart of Arsenal’s defence this season. But according to London World*, the Polish has made an immediate impact in his debut training sessions with Arsenal as he has broken several records in the fitness tests. National Daily gathered from the available report that the 22-year-old has set new benchmarks for the fastest short sprint, highest agility jump and standing spring record. And Mikel Arteta speaking at his press conference on Friday, described Kiwior as a ‘young talent with incredible potential who’s going to adapt really well to our way playing’. It was meanwhile also revealed this week that Arsenal have beaten some Serie A giants like Napoli, Juventus and AC Milan to the signing of Kiwior from Spezia. ‘All the important Italian clubs other than Inter showed interest, including Napoli, AC Milan and Juventus,’ agent Sasha Baranov told TV Play. ‘However, with Napoli’s current situation, they didn’t need to change their team in January and wanted to continue talks in the summer. You all know what happened at Juventus [points deduction], while Milan also waited, and you know what happens when the Premier League clubs come in. When a side like Arsenal come along, it becomes difficult for a 22-year-old to say no. If it was Juventus or another big club coming in, it may well have been the same situation, but Arsenal are the only side who really pushed the talks forward. ‘We honestly didn’t expect it to all move so fast, we thought he would stay in January and leave Spezia in June. Arsenal came in and the player did not put pressure on his club, he just said that if the move was to happen, then good, otherwise he was happy to wait.’
