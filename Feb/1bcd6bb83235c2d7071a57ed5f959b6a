By Leymah R. Gbowee Self-Control: restraint exercised over one’s impulses, emotions, and desires (Merriam-Webster). Contented: feeling or showing satisfaction with one’s possessions, status, or situation (Merriam-Webster). In the movie “The Plan,” a wise old man tells his grandson, “Being Contented is a Treasure that everyone should embrace.” He further asked the young man, “You know why thieves can never retire? Because the more they have, the more they want.” These two words are slowly fading from the vocabulary of most of us. We drive ourselves ragged, trying to catch up with folks who are not even paying attention to us. We engage in several activities to gain status that comes with more heartaches than joy. Once, I traveled to Peru with one of my sister-friends. We got off the plane to an airport filled with young people wanting to welcome me. We went from the airport to dinner, and the following day, we were up by 6 am to travel to another city for my first event. Throughout our three-day trip to Peru, she stayed in the back observing. As we were getting ready to fly out on the last day, she looked and me and said, “I do not envy your life. I can never do what you are doing; I can’t write speeches on the go, have meetings to raise money, and take millions of pictures with admirers.” I looked at her, laughed, and said, “You will be shocked at how many people wished they had this.” I make this point to illustrate that we must be content with where we find ourselves and restrain our desires to get achievements too quickly. This advice is mainly for young people. Don’t rush life! I am not asking you to live a life of mediocrity—last week, I cautioned against that. What I am asking is that we follow the process. Please stay on the course and keep at it. Reject the get-rich-fast impulse. The Bible says, “Godliness with contentment is great gain.”
