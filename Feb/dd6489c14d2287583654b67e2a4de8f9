    There appeared to have been a bidding war at Old Trafford over Manchester United takeover. National Daily learnt that a set of Qatari investors are in line to bid for Manchester United after they were approached by the Glazer family to discuss a takeover of the club. It is understood that the Americans had put the club on the market in November, though they remain adamant that they will listen to anything from a partial stake to a full sale. And with the Glazers seeking around £6billion for the club, interest has been somewhat limited. Meanwhile, National Daily gathered that Britain’s richest man, Sir Jim Ratcliffe has publicly declared his interest and he is the fans’ favourite to take charge having grown up as a United supporter. But he is set to face competition from a set of Qatari investors who made their interest clear with the Raine Group  who have been hired to market the sale of the club last month. However, National Daily gathered from the revelation by Sky Sports that the Qatari’s interest in United hasn’t been entirely organic after it was learnt that it was the Glazer family that approached the middle-east investors about making a bid for the club. Avram Glazer was previously reported to have been pictured at the World Cup in December, where he had the chance to meet with Qatar-based investors. Similarly, United had a site at the World Economic Forum in Davos last month, where they were hoping to ramp up interest in the club. There are expected to be two further ‘serious’ bids for the club; one from Saudi Arabia and another from America. Any full sale of the club is expected to be a record for a sports franchise and will dwarf the £2.5bn paid for Chelsea last year.
