   Another Premier League club have sacked their manager following poor results. National Daily can confirm that Leeds United have parted ways with Jesse Marsch after a poor recent run of results that has seen the club without a win since November 5th. The American took over from Marcelo Bielsa last season and managed to keep Leeds in the top flight. However, Marsch has failed to win over supporters at Elland Road and the sideâ€™s defeat at Nottingham Forest on Sunday summed up their season. Though Leeds have started brightly but failed to put away their chances, before conceding a soft goal and failing to mount a comeback. The defeat leaves the side in 17th and outside the relegation places on goal difference.
