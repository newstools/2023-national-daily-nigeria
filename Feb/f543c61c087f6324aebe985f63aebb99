 The five-time Ballon d’Or winner Cristiano Ronaldo has chosen Thursday night to celebrate a football landmark after the former Manchester United forward scored four goals on the night to reach 500 career league goals. The 37-year-old was at hand to score all four Al-Nassr’s goals in their 4-0 victory over Al-Wehda National Daily can confirm. Meanwhile,  the 37-year-old had scored his first goal for the Saudi Pro League side last week but he was able to follow that up with a clinical display at the King Abdul Aziz Stadium on Thursday night. The Portuguese achieved his latest milestone by opening the scoring for Al-Nassr in the 21st minute with a neat low finish. Ronaldo then doubled his side’s lead with another firm strike five minutes before half time.
