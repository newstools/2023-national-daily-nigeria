   Erik ten Hag has revealed that two key Manchester United players may not be available for the FA Cup clash against West Ham on Wednesday night National Daily gathered. Ten Hag’s men had got little time to rest following their Sunday’s triumph against Newcastle in the Carabao Cup final as they look to keep their ‘quadruple’ hopes alive. Sadly, the injury situation at Old Trafford has not abated  following Ten Hag’s confirmation of the unavailability of Anthony Martial alongside other long-term absentees in Donny van de Beek and Christian Eriksen. Martial has missed 28 of United’s 40 games so far this season, most recently through a hip injury. But while that news was to be expected somewhat, it has also been revealed that both Luke Shaw and Fred are doubts for the West Ham game. It is not known if they have suffered injuries or are just struggling with fitness issues, with Ten Hag simply stating in his pre-match press conference on Tuesday: ‘They are questions for tomorrow.’ The pair started the Carabao Cup final, with Shaw, who assisted Casemiro’s opening goal, playing the full game, while Fred was subbed off after 69 minutes for Marcel Sabitzer. Meanwhile, it is believed that Tyrell Malacia can easily deputize at left-back if Shaw fails fitness test, but if Fred is missing it leaves Ten Hag very short of central midfielders, with Casemiro, Sabitzer and Scott McTominay the only senior options available. But while Ten Hag has rarely rotated his team unless necessary, he is confident his squad can achieve further success this season after securing their first trophy since 2017. ‘Let’s make myself clear: we didn’t win with 11 players, we did win with a squad and I think the squad the whole season is so important and every time players come in if it’s for a whole game, minutes, a couple of games, also during games we can change the dynamics, we do it with many more than 11 players,’ he added.
