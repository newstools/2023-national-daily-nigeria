 Five members of a family were on Sunday feared dead in an auto crash along the Lagos-Badagry expressway, the News Agency of Nigeria reports.  NAN reports that the accident which occurred on Sunday night, claimed the lives of a father, mother and their three children when their Toyota Sienna rammed into a truck parked on the roadsides. Mr Sulaiman Taiwo, the Unit Commander, Federal Road Safety Commission (FRSC), Badagry, said the accident occurred around Agemowo, Buhari Estate, Badagry, Lagos. According to Taiwo, the Toyota Sienna with registration number JJJ 947 HM was coming from Agbara when it rammed into a Volvo truck, with registration number T-8101 LA. The unit commander said the driver of the car rammed into the stationary truck due to poor visibility. “The unit was alerted of the accident at about 8:45 p.m. and we arrived the scene at 9:00p.m. “The accident was fatal, father, mother and their sons were rushed to the General Hospital in Badagry, where they were confirmed dead by the doctor on duty,” he said. The unit commander appealed to the Lagos State Government and well-meaning Nigerians to provide towing vehicle for the command in Badagry. “Trucks plying Agbara-Badagry expressway always develop fault on the expressway and without a tow vehicle, we cannot move them from the road. “It is difficult to get the vehicle in this axis but if we have a towing vehicle it will be easy for us to move them out of the roads,” he said. NAN reports that an officer of Lagos Neighborhood Safety Corps (LNSC), Oluwaseun Hunsu, had on July 19, 2022, also died in an accident in the area where four other persons sustained injuries. NAN also reports that the driver of the Mazda commercial bus, with registration number LSD 470 YC, carrying Hunsu and other passengers hit a Man Diesel Tipper that was parked on the expressway.
