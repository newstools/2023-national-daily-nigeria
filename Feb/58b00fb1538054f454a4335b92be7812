 The Kogi State High Court in Lokoja has ordered the arrest and remand of the Chairman of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), Abdulrasheed Bawa, in Kuje prison for disobeying a court order. Justice Rukayat Ayoola in his judgement on Monday, February 6, also directed the Inspector General of Police to ensure compliance because the EFCC boss committed contempt of court. The judge ruled that Bawa should be remanded for the next 14 days for disobeying a court ruling delivered on November 30, 2022, wherein he was directed to produce the applicant in a case, Ali Bello.

But, EFCC’s applications for setting aside and stay of execution of the ruling were refused for want of merit.
