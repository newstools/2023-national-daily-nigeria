Nigerians are beginning to interpret  the court action of certain governors of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) at the Supreme Court on the new Naira notes swap as action not taken in the interest of citizens. They are of the view that the protesting APC governors went to the court because the proclamation of President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday that N500 and N1,000 notes were no longer legal tenders, will frustrate those governors from vote buying on election days. Nigerians, therefore, mobilise that February 25 is liberation day for citizens, urging registered voters to come out en mass for the elections. In their arguments, Nigerians stated that no Governor went to the Supreme Court to ensure the implementation N30,000 minimum wage after the approval of the President. They also pointed out that no Governor went to Supreme Court to enforce the autonomy of local governments in the country after President Buhari gave his endorsement. They also pointed out that no Governor went to the Supreme Court over non-payment of salaries and pension. Also, the governors were reminded that none went to the Supreme Court when members of ASUU were on strike for 8 months. Nigerians further expressed their disaffection with the governors in the following national issues: Fuel scarcity,  no Supreme Court order; Electricity tariff hike, no Supreme Court; bad roads, no Supreme Court order; unemployment, no Supreme Court order; poverty rate, no Supreme Court order; high inflation rate, no Supreme Court order; COVID-19 lockdown, and the palliatives hidden and denied to citizens, no Governor went to Supreme Court. Nigerians, then, declared: “Now there is no physical cash to buy votes…they remember that the masses are suffering. “Ask yourself, are these Governors really working for your interest? “February 25th is a day of liberation, by God’s grace.”
