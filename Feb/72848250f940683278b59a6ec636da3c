  Massive protest erupted in Marina, Lagos Island, Lagos, on Thursday over the non-availability of the new naira notes and the suffering of the masses. Scarcity of the new naira notes has spread across Nigeria with Nigerians groaning due to inability to access money to purchase food, transportation and other essentials. The ATMs are dry and the banks are not giving out the new notes. Today’s protest was organised by the Coalition of Civil Society groups. Hundreds of protesters stormed banks on the Island to demand the availability of the new notes.

We have gone to ATMs, we cannot access these new naira notes, we have gone to banks, we cannot access these new naira notes. “We are aware that the CBN has made available the new naira notes to the banks, and that is why the civil society leaders have taken it upon themselves to storm various banks, to tell them to stop suffering Nigerians.”
