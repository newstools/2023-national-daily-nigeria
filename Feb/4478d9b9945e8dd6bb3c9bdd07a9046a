Hundreds of thousands of bank customers are now abandoning their banks and rushing to Parallex Bank to open new accounts in the midst of the swapping of new Naira notes in the country. National Daily, visiting the two branches of the bank in Ikeja, Lagos, observed many customers scrambling for account opening forms. The rush is not unconnected with the satisfactory services rendered to the public by Parallex Bank since the beginning of the swapping of the redesigned Naira notes in the country. National Daily noticed that the Alausa and Olowu branches of Parallex Bank have been consistent in dispensing the new Naira notes at their ATM Galleries. As at Thursday, Parallex Bank was the only commercial bank dispensing cash to customers with any bank ATN card, as well as paying cash on the counter to its customers. Few other banks that minimally dispensed cash at their ATM gallery restricted such service to customers of the banks. This was noticed at Fidelity Bank along Oba Akran, Ikeja; First Bank, Oba Akran, etc. The services also lasted for few hours. At Parallex Bank branches at Alausa and Olowu, the ATM functioned all through the banking hours; customers of other banks could withdraw N10,000 limit, and Parallex Bank customers could withdraw maximum of N20,000. The crowd at both terminals was massive. Again, many PoS operators went to the ATM terminals with multiple ATM cards to boost the amount of withdrawals they make for their businesses. Meanwhile, only those depositing cash were allowed into the banking hall, while the new customers were filling their account opening forms outside for crowd control.
