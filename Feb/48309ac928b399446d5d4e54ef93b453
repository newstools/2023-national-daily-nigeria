I went back looking for POS operators, but I could not find any because, since the issue of new currency began, most POS operator locked up their business centre.” As he could not have access to his money, the couple decided to go back home, trusting God for safe delivery, he said. Unfortunately, their situation took a turn for the worse. “My wife began labour around 11 pm. Since I could not withdraw any money, I called the attention of a nurse within our locality. But as my wife delivered, blood was coming out non-stop. All efforts by the nurse to stop the bleeding failed,” he recalled.
