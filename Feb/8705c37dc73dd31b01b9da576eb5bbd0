  The Nigerian Government has accused opposition political parties of politicizing the naira scarcity Nigerians are facing, adding that they prefer to make Nigerians suffer. Minister of Information and Culture, Alhaji Lai Mohammed, stated this at the 23rd edition of President Muhammadu Buhari’s (PMB) administration scorecard series (2015-2023). The accusation is coming after 13 Nigerian political parties said they will withdraw from participating in the electoral process if these currency policies are suspended or cancelled.

He also urged Nigerians to give him a seven-day window to resolve hiccups in the implementation of the new naira scheme. “The court action came after a number of opposition parties threatened to boycott the 2023 general elections if the deadline was extended. “These curious actions by the parties concerned are clear evidence that the opposition has turned this whole issue into a political game, preferring to make Nigerians suffer more on the altar of unconscionable political gamesmanship. “Or how else can one explain the fact that these unscrupulous opposition parties do not want any action that could reduce the pains being experienced by Nigerians?’’ Mohammed accused the opposition parties of playing dirty politics by putting their interests over and above the interests of Nigerians, citing their actions would not save the political parties from losing at the polls because voters had already seen that they were the real enemies of the people. Recall that Thirteen political parties out of the 18 political parties in Nigeria have threatened to withdraw from participating in the February 25 and March 11, 2023, general elections, if the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) extends the February 10 deadline for the naira swap.
