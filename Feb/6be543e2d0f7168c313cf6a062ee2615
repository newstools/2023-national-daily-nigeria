 Chief Joemartins Uzodike, Anambra Coordinator, Peter Obi/Datti Ahmed Presidential Campaign Council, says Obi has the capacity to transform Nigeria into a great country. Uzodike said this at news conference by Peter Obi/Datti Ahmed Campaign Council and the leadership of LP in Anambra on Friday in Awka. He said Nigerians should be steadfast in supporting Obi by voting massively for LP candidates in Feb.25 and March 11 elections. “Voting all the candidates of LP is the only way Anambra people can make the difference that Mr Peter Obi is from here because Nigerians from other states have as well shown they are supporting him and are willing to vote for him,” he said. Uzodike said Nigerians should take advantage of the prevalent socio-economic and political situations to change the fortune of the country. “As you can see, there is no money anywhere because of the cashless policy and naira redesign this has made it difficult for politicians campaigning to share items to prospective voters. “Most politicians cannot afford to buy water, and snacks during rallies and this will force the masses to vote according to their conscience and by implication the right people for the first time,” he said. Also speaking, Chief Ugochukwu Emeh, State LP Chairman, hanked Nigerians for their massive support to Obi, describing it as God at work for the socio-economic and political re-engineering of the country. Emeh told Nigerians to keep faith with the Obi and other LP candidates because the present situation whereby politicians cannot afford to share money, rice and other items would force the masses to make the right choice. “Nigerians should vote LP candidates especially Peter Obi due to his credibility already shown because that is the path towards liberating the country, from past mistakes,” he said.
