The presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, showed great contest against the presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, in the 2023 presidential election in Lagos State on Saturday. The state was hitherto dominated by the APC in all previous elections. The preliminary provisional results at various polling units in several parts of Lagos showed the candidate of the Labour Party recording higher votes than every other party, with few exceptions for the APC. The APC was trailing second at most polling units, though, led in some other units. The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) suffered unusual failure at the polling units, recording very low votes. At Polling Unit 76, Yaya Abatan Street, Ogba, Ifako Ijaye LCDA, preliminary provisional result showed APC having 79 votes, Labour Party 91, and PDP 12. At Polling Unit 2, Bishop Huge st, Ifako Ijaye, APC had 57 votes, LP 77 and PDP 11. APC recorded 37 votes, LP 136, and PDP 2 votes at PU 4, Haruna Street; at PU Junction of Yaya Abatan, Ogba, APC had 47 votes, LP 55, and PDP 6 votes; beside others. At some polling units, PDP had 1 vote, in some others 2 votes. Meanwhile, until the official result is announced, it will be too early for any candidate to celebrate at the moment. However, results from several polling showed that the PDP is at the verge of collapse in Lagos State. Some voters who spoke to National Daily were of the view that the massive votes of the PDP in Lagos have been shifted to LP because of Peter Obiâ€™s candidacy. The APC, however, won virtually all the National Assembly elections in the areas covered by this Reporter in Ifako Ijaye, Ojodu, some parts of Ikeja metropolis.
