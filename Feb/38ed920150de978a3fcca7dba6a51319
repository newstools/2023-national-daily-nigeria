    The Gunners fans will be glad to have Mohamed Elneny in their warm embrace after the midfielder made a stark U-turn to declare his love for them after agreeing a new deal at the Emirates Stadium. The 30-year-old Egyptian midfielder was set to be out of contract this summer and would have been free to leave north London in just a few months’ time. However, National Daily learnt that Arsenal had on Tuesday afternoon confirmed that the former Basel star has agreed fresh terms, with his new contract set to run until the summer of 2024. Speaking after news was confirmed, he said: “I’m so happy, I love this club and our supporters so much and I’ll give everything to help us be the best we can be, every day I’m here.” “It makes me so proud to have represented this amazing club since 2016. The spirit and togetherness we have in our squad right now is so positive and I’m so happy I have extended my contract,” Elneny added. Meanwhile, National Daily can confirm that those latest comments are somewhat of an about turn from Elneny having infamously been an outspoken critic of the Gunners’ support previously. Speaking in 2021, Elneny sent a message to Arsenal fans reiterating his hope for them to continue supporting him and his teammates amid a difficult campaign. He said: “I need you to support me – not to put me down. Supporter means you have to support. “Not waiting for me to do one bad pass and then after speak about me, or one bad game. You have to support in the bad moments, not the good moments. In the good moments everybody is a supporter. “I need you when I have a bad game. When I have a bad game I need you next to me saying ‘no you are good, keep going, we are next to you’. “This will make me happy and you will make the world happy. You will make me improve more because I can see the support next to me.”
