Governor Ademola Adeleke of Osun Stater has gone on appeal, seeking to reverse the judgement of the Osun State Governorship Petitions Tribunal that annulled his election and declared former Governor Gboyega Oyetola winner of the state governorship election, citing over voting. Adeleke, who judgement as “miscarriage of justice”,  proceeded to the Court of Appeal in Akure division to reclaim his mandate, raising 31 issues to revert the judgement. Adeleke, in a 31 requests appeal suit, is demanding the court for “an order setting aside the whole decision of the tribunal”; seeking “an order striking out the petition for “want of competence and jurisdiction or in the alternative, an order dismissing the petition on the merit”. He added that “the second respondent cannot ‘go lo lo lo lo’ and ‘buga won’ as the duly elected governor of Osun State.” The governor argued that: “the tribunal, in its judgment, erred in law and displayed bias against the appellant when it made reference to the appellant’s dance at his inauguration as governor of Osun State which was never an issue before the lower tribunal. “By referring to the appellant’s personal eccentricity for dancing, the lower tribunal derided and mocked him in a manner suggesting that it was biased against him. “The appearance of bias manifests in the reference to the Appellant’s proclivity for dancing and particularly the Buga song, has rendered the decision of the lower Tribunal a nullity. “The tribunal in its judgment erred in law in returning the 1st respondent as the duly elected candidate without due regard to the enormity of the voters in the units where the results were cancelled for over-voting.”
