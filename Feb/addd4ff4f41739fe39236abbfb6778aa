   The Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani has emerged a possible new owner of the Old Trafford club. National Daily gathered that the Qatar power house is expected to make a bid of more than £4bn for Manchester United by Friday’s deadline, with those driving the purchase for the country’s ruler valuing the club at no more than £4.5bn. Though the Glazer family are understood to have set an asking price of £6bn for Manchester United, but the value of the club is believed to be not more than £4.5bn. National Daily understands that the Raine Group, which administered Chelsea’s sale, is the financial adviser to the Glazers and it is thought Friday is a soft deadline, meaning offers may be countenanced after that. And the UEFA rules disallowing clubs that can meet in the same continental competition to have the same proprietor, the Qatar power house will expect Manchester United to be administered by a different structure and personnel away from the Qatar Sports Investment as in PSG. Meanwhile, one of Britain’s richest people, billionaire Sir Jim Ratcliffe, is believed to be a contender for the Red Devils ownership after it was confirmed that his company, Ineos, is also targeting buying United. Ratcliffe, 70, is a lifelong United supporter.
