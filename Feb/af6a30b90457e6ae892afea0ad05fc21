United States District Judge Harry Leinenweber has sentenced singer R Kelly, 56, to 20 years in prison for luring multiple underage girls into sex by leveraging his wealth and fame, and in some cases, recording the abuse on video. Nineteen of those years will be served concurrently with his ongoing 30-year sentence for his 2021 conviction on racketeering and sex trafficking charges in New York federal court, with just one year served consecutively in a Chicago federal prison. He was also sentenced on Thursday to just one more year in prison for federal pedophilia charges.
