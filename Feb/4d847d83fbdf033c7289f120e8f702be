 At least two persons were reportedly shot dead on Wednesday, February 15, during protests over scarcity of new Naira notes in Benin City, Edo State. It was gathered that hundreds of residents came out in different parts of the city to staged protests as they lament the hardship that they have been subjected to following the CBN Naira redesign policy.
