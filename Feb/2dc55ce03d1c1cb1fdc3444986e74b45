There emerged crisis of distrust of the Chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, Prof. Mahmood Yakubu, at the National Collation Centre, International Conference Centre, Abuja, on Monday over the process of collation of the results which does not comply with the electronic transfer of results as INEC promised before the elections. Accordingly, Labour Party on Monday rejected the collation and announcement of the presidential election results in Abuja, protesting that INEC failed to publish all the results from polling units on its iREV server. The LP, therefore, expressed reservations over the integrity of the collation and announcement exercise by the INEC at the national collation centre in Abuja. Earlier, the two collation agents of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Dino Melaye and Emeka Ihedioha, had staged walkout from the National Collation Centre at the International Conference Centre. Dino Melaye, Emeka Ihedioha were joined by an agent of the Labour Party, including others in staging a walkout on the chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), Mahmood Yakubu, protesting the process of the collation of results from state collation officers for the presidential election (SCOPs), which they said would hamper free, fairness, credibility and transparency of the election.
