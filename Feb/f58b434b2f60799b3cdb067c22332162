There is rising disquiet in Ebonyi State over perceived domination of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Campaign Council  by Governor David Umahi, his wife, Rachel, and younger brother, Austin.
it was gathered that Governor and his wife, Rachel, head the men and women units of the campaign council, while the governor’s younger brother, Austin Umahi, is the Director General of the APC campaign council in Ebonyi State.
This led to public disquiet over the fear that the governor and his family have overbearing influence on the APC governorship candidate, Francis Nwifuru, if elected.
Austin, however, countered the agitators, saying that he is qualified to head the APC campaign council in the state. He stated that his brother, Governor Umahi only replicated the APC structure that exists at the national level, “in constituting the state’s campaign council”.
Austin declared: “The governor as a brother does not see my destiny and I have made sacrifices.
“This sort of wicked insinuation made me not to occupy any position in the first and second tenure of this government.
“All my siblings did not occupy positions but people are still writing.
“I am exceedingly qualified to head the campaign council just as all its members are also qualified.
“I am very close to Nwifuru as I am to the governor and was appointed his returning officer during the party’s primaries.
“This will not be seen as overbearing because he appointed me and I am still going to be his returning officer at the polls.
“I love him and must ensure he wins and if that is overbearing, let us achieve results.”
Austin noted that Governor Umahi is not nursing any third term agenda because it is unconstitutional.
according to him, “Such an insinuation is a product of junk journalism but one’s legacies can outlive him.
“The governor’s legacies would outlive him whether anyone likes it or not and it might be what people termed as third term.”
