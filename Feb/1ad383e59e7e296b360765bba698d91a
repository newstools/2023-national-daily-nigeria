 Former National Chairman of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC), former   Governor Adams Oshiohmole of Edo State, on Sunday cried out after buying petrol at N1,000 per litre; he bemoaned the perennial petrol scarcity and the rapid increased in the pump price of the petrol, saying that someone must be responsible for the scarcity and the arbitrary price. Ne stated that Nigerian government is still paying huge amount for petrol subsidy even as the price increases and scarcity continues. Oshiomhole speaking on Channels Television on Sunday, declared: “On one occasion, I ran out of fuel and I had to pay N1,000 for a litre. Now, that is not funny! Somebody is responsible for that.” Oshiomhole maintained: “As we speak, we are spending almost N7 trillion. The minister of finance spoke to the fact that we are spending about N7 trillion for fuel subsidy and yet most Nigerians found themselves paying much more than the market rate would be and yet we have the petroleum equalisation fund. So, people are responsible for this.” The former APC national chairman expressed the petrol scarcity is not peculiar to the government of President Muhammadu Buhari, saying it is a “perennial problem”. He quickly pointed out, “but that does not make it acceptable.”
