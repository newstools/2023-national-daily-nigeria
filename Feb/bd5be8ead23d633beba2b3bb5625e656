Comedian and Grammys host, Trevor Noah, has jokingly mocked the revelation of the Duke of Sussex, Prince Harry, about suffering from a ‘frost-bitten’ penis in his memoir, Spare. The comedian made the remark while introducing James Corden, who presented Beyoncé her Grammy award at the Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles on Sunday. According to MailOnline on Monday, Noah introduced Corden saying, “James Corden is a 12-time Emmy winner and the host of ‘The late Late Show‘. He’s also living proof that a man can move from London to L.A. and not tell everyone about his frost-bitten penis.” ALSO READ: Netanyahu hail Chad for opening embassy in Israel Harry in his memoir, revealed that he had frostbite in the early stages during William and Kate’s wedding in April 2011.
