 Nollywood actor, Mr Ibu, has said that Jasmine Okafor, is his adopted daughter following his wife, Stella’s accusation that he is having a romantic relationship with Jasmine. He clarified this along with his second son, Daniel, in an Instagram live session he had with Daddy Freeze on Friday night. Mr Ibu’s wife told a popular blogger, Gistlover, on Friday that Jasmine is having an affair with her husband and has taken over her husband’s Instagram account in an attempt to dupe him because he suffers from dementia and can’t remember things. She also stated that her children are not attending school because Jasmine has been receiving all of her husband’s income and that she must go through her before receiving money from her husband. Debunking the claim, Mr Ibu said that Stella is his second wife and that she is aware that Jasmine is his adopted daughter before he married her.
