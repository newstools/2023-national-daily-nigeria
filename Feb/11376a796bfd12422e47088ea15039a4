Three men have been charged in Australia for allegedly importing 130 kilograms of methylamphetamine hidden in paraffin wax, police said on Thursday. Australian Border Force (ABF) officers found the drug concealed within a consignment said to contain bathroom accessories and tiles, which had arrived in Sydney from Malaysia. The drug, also known as meth or ice, has an estimated potential street value of 115 million Australian dollars (80 million dollars), according to police. New South Wales police said three men, one aged 30 and two 31-year-olds, were arrested and charged with importing a commercial quantity of a border-controlled drug and participating criminal group contributing to criminal activity. State Crime Command’s Drug and Firearms Squad acting commander Stuart Gordon said the men were identified through ongoing investigations into another criminal syndicate. “The only priority for these syndicates is the profit they have a complete disregard for the harm caused when these drugs hit the streets,’’ Gordon said. Australian Federal Police detective superintendent Narelle Mitchell said the bust was another example of law enforcement working together to protect the community. He said: “This is a dangerous time to be part of an organised crime group involved in the drug trade in Australia because we are focused and relentless. “ We will use every tool we have to target you in multiple, innovative ways.”  Source – NAN
