  Former governor of Sokoto, Alhaji Attahiru Bafarawa, has revealed that the North will shock the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its presidential candidate, Bola Tinubu in February, 2023. Bafarawa stated this in an interview with BBC while reacting to a statement by the governor of Kaduna state, Nasir El-rufai that the North is in total support of Tinubu. “He (El-Rufai) was insisting that Tinubu must win the election, whether people like it or not, they have already won. Who told him that the whole of the North is supporting the APC? “This is just his opinion, in that case, he has no right to insist on the North because everybody has his candidate.

We will shock them, we will make them understand that this country belongs to nobody, likewise the North.” Bafarawa said. The former governor noted that youngsters who reason well in their youthful exuberance are better than someone who is 100 years old if we are to consider age. “He is talking about being 63, doesn’t he see that there are still elders left in the North? For us, we see that these comments are lacking in responsibility. “He thinks that we are not elders, he will understand that there are elders in the north. His comments lack being responsible and respectful, what is expected of him are comments that can lead to the development of the North and the development of the country at large. “El-Rufai talked about contesting for elections and winning, if this is what he referred to as being responsible, we have contested and won before him,” he stated.
