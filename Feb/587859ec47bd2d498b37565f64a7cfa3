The presiding judge of the Federal High Court, Abuja, Justice Obiora Egwuatu, on Monday deferred judgment on the bail application filed by Ali Bello, a nephew to Governor Yahaya Bello of Kogi State, and three others being tried by the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on allegations of N3 billion fraud, to February 14. At the resumed sitting on Monday, after Justice Egwuatu had on February 8, adjourned for ruling on the bail application by the defendants who had pleaded not guilty to the 18-count charge, counsel to the defendants, Ahmed Raji (SAN), notified the court that the EFCC had filed a counter affidavit to the bail application. The counsel noted that the counter affidavit was filed on Friday, February 10, making it impossible for them to reply. Justice Egwuatu noted that there are no copies of the counter affidavit in his record. Counsel to the EFCC notified the court that the counter affidavit was mistakenly filed before another judge. Justice Obiora Egwuatu, however,  adjourned the case to Tuesday to enable the counsels regularise their processes.
