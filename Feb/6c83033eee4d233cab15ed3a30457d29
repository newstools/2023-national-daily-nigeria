A High court sitting at the Tafawa Balewa Square, Lagos has ordered kidnap kingpin, Chukwudumeme Onwuamadike aka Evans to refund the sum of €233,000 ransom he collected from one of his victims, Chief Donatus Dunu. Justice Olukayode Ogunjobi on Wednesday, February 15, also ordered the convicted kidnapper to pay N50 million as general damages in favour of the Claimant. Evans abducted Dunu, who is a pharmacist, on February 14, 2017. Duru later escaped from captivity after the convicted kidnapper took €233,000 from his family. Upon his escape, Dunu, who is the CEO of Maydon Pharmaceutical Company, filed a suit demanding the return of the sum of £223,000 he paid as ransom while in the custody of the kidnap kingpin. He also demanded the sum of N50 million as damages.
