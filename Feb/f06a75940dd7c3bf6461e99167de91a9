 The report reaching National Daily suggests that Chelsea’s board have vowed to stick by Graham Potter ahead of a crucial week at Stamford Bridge with the clashes against Leeds and Dortmund in the Premier League and Champions Leagues respectively. The 47-year-old former Brighton boss is under severe pressure after Chelsea’s 2-0 defeat to London rivals Tottenham on Sunday, leaving the Blues with just one win in 11. National Daily can confirm that Chelsea have scored just one goal in February and they have found the back of the net with just one of their last 60 shots in the Premier League. Meanwhile, it was Todd Boehly’s decision to sack Thomas Tuchel in September and to replace him with Potter, and the American feels invested in ensuring the former Brighton boss succeeds at Stamford Bridge. But doubts are growing within Chelsea’s squad that Potter can turn things around in west London. Chelsea face Leeds this weekend, before taking on Dortmund in the last-16 of the Champions League where they trail 1-0 from the first leg. Sacking Potter ahead of these games is seen as some as the club’s last opportunity to salvage their campaign. But the Guardian say Boehly has no intention of sacking Potter and is intent on sticking by him, regardless of the results in the next two games.
