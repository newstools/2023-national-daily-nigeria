They said the inability of INEC to upload results electronically on its results viewing portal (IReV) at the polling units left them prone to manipulation. “This election is not free and far from being fair,” Abure said. The parties also declared a vote of no confidence on the INEC chairman. The LP, PDP and ADC said the deliberate refusal of the INEC chairman to respect the upload of results electronically as stipulated by Section 60 of the Electoral Act 2022 is unacceptable. The three parties said the result so far by INEC showed “monumental disparities” between what the party agents signed and what INEC officials announced in Abuja.
