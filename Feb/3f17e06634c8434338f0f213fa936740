President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday met with the Governor of the Central Bank (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, at the State House, Abuja, for the third time on the Naira notes redesign and the crisis over the swap of the old notes with the new ones. National Daily gathered that Governor Emefiele departed the State House, refusing to speak to State House Correspondents on the meeting. The monetary policy had caused scarcity of money in the country before and after the CBN deadline, including the extension of the delaine for swapping old ones. President Buhari had last week convened a meeting of the national Council of States in Abuja, where participants endorse the Naira redesign, but advised on printing of more notes or allowing the old notes co-exist with the new notes.
