Several Electoral Officers encountered difficulties in uploading the results of the presidential election on Saturday from their polling units in some parts of Lagos State. National Daily engaged most of the Electoral Officers Â at various polling units in Ogba, Haruna, Obawole, and other parts of Ifako Ijaye, who admitted difficulties in uploading results of the presidential election into the INEC server from their units, citing network failure. At some polling units, the electoral officers told National Daily that the results of the senatorial and house of representatives elections have been uploaded but they encountered difficulties uploading the results of the presidential election. Some of the officers said they were unable to upload results of the three federal elections from their units. The Officers, however, told National Daily that the polling agents of the various parties already have records of the results announced at the units. At the time of this report, some electoral officers were still making efforts to transmit the results to the INEC server, struggling with network problem. Some voters volunteered to provide data for the officers to ensure that the results were transmitted before they depart the polling units. Virtually all party agents left without ensuring that the results were uploaded into the INEC server. Few, however, insisted on the electronic transmission of results but were assured by the electoral officers that they would do it. The Saturday presidential election was peaceful in Lagos.
