  The All Progressives Congress (APC) has summoned an emergency meeting of all governors elected under its platform. The meeting will be held at the party’s National Secretariat in Abuja on Sunday by 2.00pm. This is contained in a statement issued by the party’s Publicity Secretary, Felix Morka, on behalf of the National Chairman. The statement read: “The National Chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), His Excellency, Senator Abdullahi Adamu, invites State Governors of the Party to an emergency meeting to be held on Sunday, February 19, 2023 by 2pm at the National Secretariat, Abuja.

Ten governors of the APC had dragged the Federal Government and the CBN to the Supreme Court to stop them from withdrawing the old N200, N500 and N1000 notes from circulation. The apex court granted a restraining order stopping the FG, CBN and banks from enforcing the February 10 deadline for the submission of the old notes. But Buhari, in a nationwide address on Thursday trampled the Supreme Court underfoot and announced that only the N200 notes should be in circulation in flagrant disobedience to the Supreme Court’s ruling. It is believed that Sunday’s meeting is meant to make the hardline governors shift ground and probably withdraw the case against Buhari and CBN at the apex court. It is not certain if the governors will dance to the tune of Adamu as Buhari’s obnoxious Naira redesign policy is seriously demarketing the APC candidates.
