 INEC says it will work with the Lagos state parks management committee for the distribution of election materials and personnel in the state. Olusegun Agbaje, INEC resident electoral commissioner in Lagos, made this known on Tuesday, February 7, during the inter-agency consultative committee on election security (ICCES) meeting at the commission’s office in Lagos. According to the News Agency of Nigeria, he said: “There is a ban on the NURTW and RTEAN, we are only left with the Park Management system and NARTO (National Association of Road Transport Owners) and we are already working with NARTO. NARTO is not even able to meet up with 40 percent of our vehicle requirements for this election. The commission in Lagos State does not have any option than to use park management system. We are not dealing with Oluomo, we are dealing with the park managers. Individual people that have vehicles are those we are going to use.
