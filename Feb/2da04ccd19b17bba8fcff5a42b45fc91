The Labour Party (LP) on Sunday, February 26, has alleged that one of its agent was forced to sign an election result sheet at gunpoint in Lagos. This was revealed by a female party agent at the Lagos state collation center when it was announced that the party polled 28,951 votes. The lady rejected the votes claiming that the actual votes were 29,222. The officials said her complaint was subject to debate because her party’s agent signed the result sheet, but she noted the agent did it under duress.⁣ “The agent reported to me he had to sign at gunpoint. That’s exactly what happened,” she said.⁣ However, the LP official also strongly rejected the result of Lagos Mainland LGA when it was announced, but officials said the party’s agent also signed the result.⁣
