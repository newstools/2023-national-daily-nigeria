   Southampton who occupy bottom of the Premier League are without a manager after the sack of Nathan Jones last week. National Daily can confirm that the Saints have endured a dismal run of form after winning just once in their last five matches prior to the exit of Jones. Meanwhile, the report reaching National Daily reveals that Manchester United legendary striker Wayne Rooney is interested in calling the shots at Saint Mary’s stadium and is open to holding talks with the club over their vacant managerial position. Rooney, who is in his second stint as manager of DC United, turned down the chance to speak to boyhood club Everton after they sacked Rafael Benitez last year. However, the fortune of the former Derby County boss cannot be ascertained considering the fact that his second stint in Washington is not going to plan, with DC United losing nine of his 15 matches so far. Nonetheless, it is believed that Rooney now feels more open to returning to the Premier League and while speaking to TalkSPORT, the 37-year-old declared his interest in the Southampton job. Rooney is believed to likely face competition from former national team-mates, Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard for the position but Southampton are keen to make a quick appointment. Though Rooney has left his last job in England with Derby County after the club were relegated to League One, but on a high. He was understood to have left with a stronger reputation than when he started after nearly keeping the club in the Championship despite a heavy points deduction.
