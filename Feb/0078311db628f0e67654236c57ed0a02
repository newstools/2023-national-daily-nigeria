 The Sir Ahmadu Bello Memorial Foundation on Tuesday urged Nigerians to use the forthcoming elections to elect leaders who will advance the nation’s democracy, socio-economic development and prosperity. Abubakar Umar, Director General of the Foundation, made the appeal in a statement issued in Kaduna. “Election is not a battlefield to gain advantages over candidates, party, tribe, region or religion. “Rather it is another litmus test for the peace and unity of the country,” he added. Umar urged the electorate to come out en-mass and vote peacefully in the spirit of sportsmanship under an atmosphere of free and fair contest. “We also wish to reiterate that the coming general elections are the most consequential in the political history of the country, as it offers us an opportunity to improve on the integrity of our elections as well as the quality of governance in our country.” According to him, all stakeholders should therefore engage actively and contribute to a violent-free election. “No persons should be maimed or killed, or properties of innocent citizens destroyed during the elections,” he added. The managing director said security agencies should ensure the protection of lives and properties of all citizens anywhere in the country. “We enjoin various candidates and their supporters to eschew violence and embrace the judicial process of seeking redress, as the peace and unity of the country is far greater than any other consideration. “The foundation prays that we choose leaders whose mandates are directed towards the concern and welfare of the common Nigerian,” Umar added.
