   Dumebi Kachikwu, the presidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), has warned that the desperation to stop the presidential flag bearer of the All Progressives Congress, APC, Sen Bola Tinubu shouldn’t plunge Nigeria into a state of anarchy. Kachikwu stated this on Friday while expressing his concern over the hardship being faced by Nigerians due to the CBN naira redesign. According to him, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) naira redesign policy was designed purely to target Tinubu, adding that it was ill-timed and poorly implemented. “It’s heart-breaking to see that Nigerians have died, banks burnt, property destroyed, and millions suffering as they desperately try to access an unavailable naira.” READ ALSO: Tinubu never asked governors to disregard President Buhari – APC He added: “Tens of millions of Nigerians operate within the informal sector and earn daily wages between N500 to N10,000 in cash. “Most of them live in unbanked or underbanked parts of Nigeria and they now bear the brunt of this ill-conceived policy. Don’t we’ve any conscience as leaders? How do we go to bed at night knowing that Nigerians are queuing outside banks all through the night just to get N5000? “Poor Nigerians bear the burden of the failures associated with this recolouring. This is evil, Nigerians should not have to die because politicians are fighting for the soul of our nation”. This is coming amidst the worsening scarcity of the new naira notes across Nigeria. Earlier this week, angry citizens piled up the pressure with protests taking place simultaneously across Nigeria. On Thursday, President Muhammadu Buhari directed the CBN to intensify collaboration with various anti-corruption agencies in checking the activities of those bent on frustrating the implementation of the currency redesign policy.
