   Former APC’s National Chairman, Adams Oshiomhole has described the Naira redesign policy of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) as being senseless and mischievous. According to him, the intention behind it was to stop the elections. Oshiomhole, who spoke in an interview on Channels TV’s election programme “The 2023 Verdict,” on Sunday, said he could guess that in obtaining the approval, the CBN deceived the president by amplifying the need to have corruption-free electioneering as if election is the only project this president has a responsibility for.
