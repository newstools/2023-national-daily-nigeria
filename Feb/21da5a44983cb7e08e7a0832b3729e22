 The old N200, N500 and N1000 notes ceased being legal tender since February 10, 2023, the CBN has declared. This is coming despite the ruling of the Supreme Court in Abuja that banned the apex bank from implementing the February 10 expiration date for the old notes. Haladu Idris Andaza, CBN’s branch controller in Bauchi, disclosed this to newsmen on Monday, February 13. According to DailyTrust, he said, “For the avoidance of doubt, we wish to state categorically that CBN is ready and is open to receive all of those old notes based on certain conditions and criteria.
