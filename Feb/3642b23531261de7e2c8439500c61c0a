A 15-year-old boy who entered a shipping container during a game of hide-and-seek, has been discovered a week later in another country. The teen from Bangladesh — identified only by his first name, Fahim — was playing with friends in the port city of Chittagong on January 11 when he hid inside the container and fell asleep, India Times reports. The container was then loaded on a commercial ship headed to Malaysia, where the boy was discovered in West Port six days later on January 17. He fell asleep only to wake up 2,000 miles away from home and in Malaysia. It turned out that he sailed with Integra container ship across the Indian Ocean after he was mistakenly locked up. However, officials said he had a fever and was taken to a nearby hospital for examination. After an investigation, officials said the teen had wandered into the container during a game of hide-and-seek.
