 The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) on Wednesday, February 8, re-arraigned comedienne Adedamola Adewale better known as Adeherself, for alleged N7.9 million internet fraud. National Daily reports that Adewale was charged alongside two others at large, on a three-count charge of conspiracy to obtain money by false pretences, attempt to obtain money by false pretences and retention of proceeds of criminal conduct. She, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge before Justice Mojisola Dada of an Ikeja Special Offences Court. EFCC counsel, Mr Samuel Daji, informed the court that the case was re-assigned, and urged it to remand the defendant pending commencement of trial.
