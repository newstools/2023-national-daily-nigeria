  The Lagos Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) has warned that businesses are suffering the consequences of CBN’s currency management policy lapses. This was disclosed by the Director General of LCCI, Dr Chinyere Alumona on Friday, as reported by the News Agency of Nigeria. The LCCI’s warning comes at a time Nigerians are enduring heavy roadblocks due to the scarcity of naira notes following the apex bank’s naira redesign and cashless policies. Dr. Chinyere Alumona stated that when redesigned Naira notes were launched in December, expectations were high for a smooth transition, however, Nigerians now regret as expectations have been dashed with business deals impeded and  time and value lost.

Businesses are suffering the consequences of the CBN currency management policy lapses. “Regarding the deadline extension for phasing out old notes, the chamber does not see any value in this if the scarcity of the new Naira notes persists.” The LCCI boss added that despite initially supporting the policy, the phasing out of old notes and redesign should have been better planned by the CBN without causing hardship for businesses.
