  Pep Guardiola has addressed rival clubs after warning them to ‘be careful’ after Man City were hit with over 100 charges by the Premier League in relation to alleged breaches National Daily can confirm. The Etihad club were accused of breaking financial rules by the Premier League, who have issued them with 115 charges that span across a 14-year period. National Daily recalls that City were banned from UEFA competitions in 2020 and fined £25m for breaking Financial Fair Play rules but an appeal saw the ban removed and the fine reduced to £10m. Meanwhile, the Premier League’s allegations are far more extensive and could see City kicked out of the division in a worst-case scenario. But, speaking in a prickly press conference on Friday afternoon, a defiant Guardiola insisted City are innocent and he doubled-down on his belief that the charges are motivated by influence from the other 19 Premier League clubs in the division. ‘They [the other 19 Premier League clubs] have set a precedent,’ said Guardiola. They have opened a precedent right now, what they have done to us. ‘Be careful, be careful in the future as there’s a lot of clubs that have been accused like we have without being innocent, who knows what will happen in the future? “They believe that we didn’t behave properly, we can accept that, but let us defend when we believe we did it properly.” “It happened with Uefa, it has happened today, and we haven’t learnt from that.” Asked whether the charges were being motivated by moves from other clubs, Guardiola replied: ‘You should go to the chairmans, the CEO’s, Daniel Levy, and ask them.’
