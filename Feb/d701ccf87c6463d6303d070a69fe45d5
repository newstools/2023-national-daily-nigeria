Oshiomhole cries out A former Edo State Governor, Adams Oshiohmole, has lamented the the hike in pump price across the country. Speaking in an interview with Channel Television on Sunday, February 5, the All Progressives Congress (APC) chieftain said he recently bought a litre of fuel at N1,000. According to him, “On one occasion, I ran out of fuel and I had to pay N1,000 for a litre. Now, that is not funny! Somebody is responsible for that. As we speak, we are spending almost N7 trillion.
