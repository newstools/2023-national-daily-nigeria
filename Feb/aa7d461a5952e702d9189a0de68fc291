The Oluwo of Iwo, Oba AbdulRosheed Akanbi, has declared presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, is the choice of royal fathers in Yoruba land. According to him, no one is above the king in Yoruba land and so their decision on Tinubu becoming the next President is binding. The monarch, who spoke at the Yoruba and Southwest Leaders of Thought Summit, stressed:”nobody is older than a king in Yorubaland, and Bola Ahmed Tinubu is our son, and we must support him.” READ ALSO: Tinubu, APC oppose appointment of Naja’atu as Coordinator of Police Commission He said: “We in Yorubaland cannot leave our son and vote for another person. We accept anyone in Afenifere who accepts Tinubu, and renounce whoever does not accept him. We are king over such persons/people and we are saying it is Tinubu we want. “The pronouncement by the Kings has erased whatever they are saying. Who in Yorubaland is older than a king? Anyone in my kingdom who says he is older than me would have to be patient because I am lord over him. “I believe in the unity of Nigeria ‘s existence and I believe this is our time. Even the north is with us.  I am not someone who prays; if you need prayers go to the church or a mosque. I, as a king, make this pronouncement, let us vote for Bola Tinubu on February 25.”
