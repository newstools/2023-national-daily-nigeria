Pastor Paul Enenche, Founder, Senior Pastor of the Dunamis Gospel Centre, on Monday, added momentum to the campaign of the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, as parties are rounding up campaigns for the February 25 elections. Enenche, displaying a picture of Peter Obi, himself and Bishop David Oyedepo, sent out a strong message, declaring that Obi is the way to go in the presidential election. Pastor Enenche displaying the picture on his facebook page, and pointing at Peter Obi, wrote: “A picture they say is worth a thousand words. This picture was randomly taken by a photographer some time ago but is speaking volumes right now, especially in this season. “What do you see? What can you hear? Are you in doubt about the way to go? The way of integrity, authenticity, honesty, sincerity, simplicity, humility, capacity, productivity; here is the way to go.” Bishop David Oyedepo of Living faith Church, Winners Chapel, stood in between Obi and Enenche smiling.
