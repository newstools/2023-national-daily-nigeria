A former Nigerian lawmaker, Shehu Sani, has advised Nigerians against voting for a candidate because their religious leaders asked them to. The senator made this known via his Twitter page on Tuesday. Sani said that electing a wrong leader in the coming election would plunge the country into another four years of darkness. He wrote, “On Saturday, this country has a date with history. Don’t vote for a Candidate because your Mosques or Churches asked you to do so. “Be guided by your conscience and experience & elect a competent leader. A wrong choice is another 4 years of journey into darkness.”
