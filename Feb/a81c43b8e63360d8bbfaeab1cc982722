    Chelsea on Tuesday broke the British record transfer for World Cup winner Enzo Fernandez after splashing a huge £106.4m for the midfielder. The Blues splashed a staggering £288million in the January window after capturing Fernandez, Mykhailo Mudryk, Benoit Badiashile, Joao Felix, Noni Madueke, Andrey Santos, David Datro Fofana and Malo Gusto (though loaned back to Lyon). Meanwhile, problems have emerged for Chelsea boss Graham Potter after it appeared that there is a chance the £106.4m midfielder may not play for his new club in the Champions League. National Daily gathered that Chelsea have to 11pm on Thursday to submit their 25-man squad list for the UCL knockout stage, which kicks-off in two weeks time, with the Blues taking on Borussia Dortmund. They named a 24-man squad for the group stage which leaves one spot open to adding a player, however UEFA rules stipulate that only three new players can be registered. All in all, this means that not only will some of the January signings miss out but also that two of the current players will have to be cut from the list. Santos and Fofana are not expected to be part of the first-team yet, while it is also said that 20-year-old Madueke is likely to miss out but that still gives Potter a selection dilemma between the remaining quartet. As for who could be dropped, the manager may have an easier decision to make given Chelsea’s extensive injury list. Christian Pulisic and N’Golo Kante are not expected back until March so would be prime candidates to be cut, but Armando Broja, who will remain on the sidelines until the end of the season, is not as he did not feature on the original list anyway. In the meantime, Chelsea will be preparing for their next Premier League game on Friday when they will host local rivals Fulham.
