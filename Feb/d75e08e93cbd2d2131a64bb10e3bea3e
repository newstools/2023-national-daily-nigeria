National Daily learnt that James speaking to beIN Sport after Chelsea’s defeat to Spurs, maintained:  ‘Nothing happens overnight.’ ‘We don’t just wake up tomorrow and we’re out of the situation we’re in, it’s going to take weeks and months to get to where we’re meant to be. ‘But we’re all on the same page, we’re sticking together and that’s a big positive.’ Asked if Potter is as good as previous Chelsea managers he’s played under, James replied: ‘Yeah, for sure. ‘Everyone has seen how good of a manager he is. That showed when he was at Brighton and they were in and around top four. ‘His ability is definitely not questionable. ‘He’s in a similar position to us players – we’re the ones out there on the pitch performing – so just as much stick he gets the players are playing as well, we’re in it together. ‘I think it’s hard to say, it’s not like we’re not trying, we’re giving it our all but results are simply not going our way at the moment. ‘It’s not like the players are sacking it, or anything like this, we’re working hard, it’s just results are not falling our way at the moment.’
