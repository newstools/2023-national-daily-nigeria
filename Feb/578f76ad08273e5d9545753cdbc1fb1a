That is why he is contesting. But we have come to a point where people are living under a delusion; they don’t want to see facts and accept them as facts. “Like my friend Bola, for obvious reasons he has a lot of money. He has been pumping in and people are after that money. They continue to feed him with what he wants to hear. The man said that his life ambition is to be president. He will accept any information that will reinforce that ambition. So they create a sense of delusion. So they are the only people seeing the results.”
