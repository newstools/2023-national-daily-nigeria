   Manchester United midfield maestro Casemiro who was named Man of the Match as the Red Devils won their first trophy after six years was seen unhappy after his side beat Newcastle United in the Carabao Cup final. The 31-year-old Brazilian who opened the scoring at Wembley when he headed in Luke Shaw’s free-kick in the first half picked his first trophy as a Manchester United player. National Daily can meanwhile confirm that United had plenty of chances to grab a third goal after Marcus Rashford had doubled their lead and nobody was as guilty of squandering the space left in behind by Newcastle as they pushed forward than Bruno Fernandes. The Portuguese playmaker was put through on goal late on and he had the chance of slipping in either Jadon Sancho or Scott McTominay. But Fernandes opted to go himself and after cutting back, he saw his effort saved by Loris Karius. The game was effectively over by that point but Casemiro, a five-time Champions League winner showed his elite mentality by digging out Fernandes during the celebrations afterwards. National Daily learnt that Casemiro was captured making a beeline for Fernandes as United’s players prepare to walk the famous Wembley steps. The ex-Real Madrid midfielder could clearly be seen having a go at his team-mate, gesturing with his hand to the area where Fernandes failed to pass as the Portuguese jokingly takes part and defends himself, perhaps suggesting he had no other option but to shoot. Casemiro however eventually allowed a smile to sweep across his face as he prepared to lift his first trophy as a United player. Meanwhile, the Red Devils had got it all busy with the clash against West Ham at Old Trafford in the FA Cup on Wednesday in sight.
