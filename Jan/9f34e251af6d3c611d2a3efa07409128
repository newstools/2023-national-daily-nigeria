The spokesperson of the Tinubu/Shettima Presidential Campaign of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Festus Keyamo SAN, on Tuesday responded to the endorsement of the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, by Chief Edwin Clark, leader of the Pan-Niger Delta Forum (PANDEF), after former President Olusegun Obasanjo had earlier on Sunday announced his endorsement of Obi for the 2023 presidential ambition. Keyamo, Minister of State for Labour and Employment, in a tweet stated that the elder statesmen endorsed Atiku Abubakar of the PDP in 2019, saying that “the votes they gave Atiku in 2019, they have carried those votes to Obi.” He stated that Clark, who he described as his father, has never supported the APC since 2015. The APC presidential campaign spokesperson in a tweet wrote: Festus Keyamo, SAN @fkeyamo “Same thing I said for OBJ that applies to my respected father, Edwin Clark. These are elders who endorsed Atiku Abubakar in 2019. The votes they gave Atiku in 2019, they have carried those votes to Obi. My father, Edwin Clark HAS NEVER SUPPORTED APC for the Presidency since 2015.”
