  Presidential candidate of the African Democratic Congress, Dumebi Kachikwu, has accused the ruling APC of presenting another sick candidate to Nigerians. Speaking on Wednesday, Kachikwu also called for the withdrawal of Bola Tinubu from the presidential race on grounds of ill-health. “Buhari had good intentions in mind when he ran for office but when his health failed his government also failed. Today, the same APC that failed the Nigerian people with a sick president has presented another sick candidate. “There is nothing wrong with being old or sick as we will all get old someday. We will also all get sick at some point or the other. What I do have a problem with, is a candidate with significant cognitive disabilities.
