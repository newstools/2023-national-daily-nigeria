  Media director of the  APC presidential campaign council, Bayo Onanuga, has defended Bola Tinubu over a statement he made during a rally at Abeokuta, Ogun state. Tinubu was quoted to have said that the scarcity of petrol and the naira redesign would not affect his chances of securing victory. Phrank Shaibu, an aide to Atiku Abubakar, presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), said Tinubu was using the problems as an excuse for his imminent defeat. In a statement on Thursday, Bayo Onanuga, the council’s director of media, said Tinubu was only drawing Buhari’s attention to saboteurs “possibly working in cahoots with the PDP”.

No political blackmail and an attempt to create a conflict between Tinubu and his long-term ally, President Muhammadu Buhari can succeed. “The Atiku rudderless campaign, always seeking cheap shots and easy ways has again woefully attempted to make a mountain out of a molehill from the comments made by Asiwaju Tinubu in Abeokuta. he said as a patriotic leader, Asiwaju Tinubu will not stomach seeing ordinary Nigerians being made to face excessive difficulties over mundane issues.
