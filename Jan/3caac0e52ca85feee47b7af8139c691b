The All Progressives Congress (APC) Presidential Campaign Council (PCC), at the opening ceremony of the distribution of 1,000 bags of assorted food items donated by Senator Kabiru Marafa to a community in Zamfara State, berated critics of Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket of the party, saying that those opposed to the APC Muslim/Muslim presidential ticket are not sincere, arguing that politics is not about religion but about choices. Marafa declared that those opposed to the APC Muslim-Muslim presidential ticket are hypocrites. Marafa, Coordinator of the Asiwaju/ Shettima Presidential Campaign Council, said that the distribution of food items was a gesture of reaching out to put smiles on their faces of people, as well as to assure them that there is nothing ominous about the APC’s presidential ticket. According to Marafa,  “The Tinubu/Shettima Presidential Campaign Council has donated 1,000 bags of rice and corn flour to the Christian community in our state to celebrate Christmas and the New Year. “The gesture is aimed at joining our Christian brothers in celebrating the festive season which we also got the full support of Governor Bello Matawalle in achieving this. “This issue of Muslim-Muslim ticket that people are crying about, most of it is hypocrisy because politics is not about religion or anything, it is about choice and nobody says there is just one political party in Nigeria.” The former Senator stated that the APC in Zamfara State has put strategies in place for victory at all levels in the 2023 elections.
