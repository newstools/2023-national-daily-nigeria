The Commissioner of Cooperatives and Small and Medium Enterprises Development, Sa’adatu Bello Kirfi, has resigned her appointment hours after her father, Bello Kirfi, was stripped of his traditional title as ‘Wazirin Bauchi’ and removed as a member of the Bauchi Emirate Council. Kirfi, who was a retired federal civil servant, Second Republic Minister and former Minister of Special Duties, was removed over his alleged “disloyalty and disrespect” to the State Governor, Bala Mohammed.
