Four-time Grand Slam champion, Naomi Osaka, has announced that she is expecting her first child, and plans to return to tennis in 2024. She made this known on her social media pages on Wednesday where she posted picture of a baby’s sonogram. Osaka shared a note alongside the sonogram saying, “The past few years have been interesting to say the least, but I find that it’s the most challenging times in life that may be the most fun. These few months away from the sport has really given me a new love and appreciation for the game I’ve dedicated my life to. “I realize that life is so short and I don’t take any moment for granted, everyday is a new blessing and adventure. I know that I have so much to look forward to in the future, one thing I’m looking forward to is for my kid to watch my matches and tell someone, ‘that’s my mom’. “2023 will be a year that’s full of lessons for me and I hope to see you guys at the start of the next one because I’ll be at Aus 2024. Love you all infinitely.”
