The spokesperson for the Peoples Democratic Party Presidential Campaign Council, Dino Melaye, has expressed anger at being linked to two Nigerian skit makers, Ashmusy and Nons Miraj. Controversial blogger, Gistlover, took to its Instagram account to share a picture collage of Ashmusy, Dino Melaye and Nons Miraj on Tuesday and captioned it, “I like fine fine pictures sha. Hard work under Dino no be small work oo. I dey come.” Melaye, who reshared a screenshot of Gistlover’s story on his verified Facebook account on Wednesday, lashed out at the blogger and threatened to sue over the story. He said, “I will sue you this time. Will locate you. I don’t know any of these ladies. Agent of APC. You will not get away with your lies and unfounded story this time. You just dialled the wrong number. Apologise within 24 hours or face consequences.”
