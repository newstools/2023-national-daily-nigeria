  Frank Lampard can now be referred as Everton’s former manager following his sack by the Meseryside club after a 10-game winless run. The 44-year-old former Chelsea manager was appointed little under a year ago, replacing Rafa Benitez when the club were 16th and four points above the relegation zone, and helped guide them to safety with one game to spare. But the Toffees have failed to push on since then and have endured another miserable season, slipping to 19th place in the Premier League table – only ahead of bottom-placed Southampton on goal difference. After failing to win since October 22, Everton’s board have finally decided to pull the trigger and are now in the process of looking for a new manager Lampard went into Saturday’s clash against West Ham knowing that defeat could cost him his job and Everton duly lost 2-0, giving another meek and lacklustre performance. There are a number of managers in the frame to succeed the former Chelsea midfielder, with ex-Burnley boss Sean Dyche the bookie’s favourite. The likes of Marcelo Bielsa, former Goodison Park hero Wayne Rooney, survival expert Sam Allardyce and even David Moyes have all been linked with the job too.
