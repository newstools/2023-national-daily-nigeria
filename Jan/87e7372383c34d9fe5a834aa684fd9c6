The Tinubu/Shettima Campaign Organization on Monday accused the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, of alleged money laundering and a breach of the penal and criminal code, calling for his prosecution. The Tinubu/Shettima Campaign Organization at a press conference in Abuja, stated that Atiku does not enjoy any immunity. Heads of media directorates of the organisation who include Dele Alake, Festus Keyamo, Bayo Onanuga, Femi Fani-Kayode, and Idris Mohammed,  told Atiku to resign his candidature and apologise to Nigerians for allegedly using private accounts to siphon monies from the public treasury. The campaign organisation threatened to pursue legal means to seek the former vice president’s disqualification from the February presidential elections for alleged corruption. A former aide to Atiku, Michael Achimugu, was said to have accused the former VP of corruption which provided the Tinubu Campaign media to launch attack on Atiku. Achimugu was said to have alleged that the former Vice president through the Special Purpose Vehicle scheme, took funds from a former Plateau State governor ,Joshua Dariye, who was convicted for the misappropriation of the Ecological Fund. The SA Public Communications for Atiku, Phrank Shaibu, refuted the allegation of Achimugu, dismissing it as “hear say”.
