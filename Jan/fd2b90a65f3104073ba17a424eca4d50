A non-governmental organisation (NGO), Royal  International Charity Friends Club (TMB), during a visit to Ifebi Medical Centre and other hospitals for  its annual charity service to humanity, paid N1.5 million to settle medical bills of some patients in the selected private hospitals in Anambra State. The NGO engages in several social services annually to uplift the lives of people within its environment. Founder and President of the Royal  International Charity Friends Club (TMB), Chief Maxwell Obi, explained that the major goal of the club is to give back to the society and express gratitude to God for His blessings upon the life of members. Obi said the level of hardships in the country is too much for any wealthy person or persons, who could give assistance, to wait for government to do all the work of providing basic amenities to the people. “The hot desire to make positive impact in lives of our people have been burning in me for years, so when God blessed me, I looked for people with same ideology; over 20 young family men who understand what hardship means came together to form the NGO. “The TMB was formed and registered with CAC in March 2020 with aim to positively impact on lives, no matter how small they could in a legitimate manner that is allowed in the country. Secretary of the Royal  International Charity Friends Club, Chief Callistus Ozichukwu,  said that the group members were mostly based abroad and came to Nigeria annually to hold meetings and plan for their charity services. Ozichukwu said that the philanthropy ranged from scholarship scheme, economic empowerment to widow upliftment and youth development across the states. Chief Tochukwu Udeogaranya, Treasurer of the group, said that the group was designed to assist people of low or average class, to enjoy tasteful life through their help.
