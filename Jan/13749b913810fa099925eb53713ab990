The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, at the party’s presidential campaign on Wednesday at the M.K.O. Abiola Stadium, Abeokuta, Ogun State, may have raised alarm over perceived or real sabotage of his presidential ambition in the 2023 general elections. He, however, expressed optimism that he will win the February presidential election in spite of the petrol scarcity and the change of the colour of Naira notes by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The APC presidential candidate was also cited to have alleged that certain saboteurs are plotting to stop the 2023 general elections. Tinubu, accordingly, was gathered to have played down the lingering petrol scarcity, high price of the pump price of petrol, and the redesigned Naira notes, saying that it will not be possible for anyone to scatter the 2023 elections, reiterating that he will win the election. According to Tinubu, “this is a superior revolution.” Tinubu was cited to have declared in Yoruba: “Let fuel be expensive, only they know where they keep it. Keep petrol, keep the naira, we will vote and be elected. “You may change the ink of naira notes. What you expect will not happen. We will win. “They said petrol will rise to N200/litre and N500/litre, let your mind be at rest. They don’t want these forthcoming elections to hold. They want to scatter it but that won’t be possible. “They thought they could cause trouble; they sabotaged fuel but with or without fuel, with or without motorcycles and tricycles, we will vote and win. This is a superior revolution.” Tinubu further asserted: “We will take over government through our PVCs. “Even if they say there is no fuel, we will trek to the polling units.” Abeokuta has been a hot venue for Tinubu’s campaign. He appears to derive more confidence in Abeokuta to make political outburst. He did this before the APC national convention, after which he emerged the party’s presidential candidate.
