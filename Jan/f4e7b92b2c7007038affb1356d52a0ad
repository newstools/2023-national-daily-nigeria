 These are obviously not the good moments at Anfield as Liverpool’s push for a top four finish suffered further crisis with star defender Virgil van Dijk set for spell on sidelines as injury sustained against Brentford is worse than first feared. The Reds have gone ahead to lose 3 – 1 thus denting their hope of finishing on the top four. Meanwhile, Liverpool crisis has now grown deeper as they are set to be without Van Dijk for an extended period after scan results indicated his hamstring injury is ‘worse than first feared’. The Dutchman had come off at half-time in their 3-1 defeat to Brentford on Monday. The 31-year-old was far from his usual self in the first half, which saw the Bees go into half-time with a two-goal lead. Van Dijk managed to make it to the interval without needing to come off and it was hoped that his removal prevented any significant damage. However, National Daily gathered from the report by the Times that the defender is now set for a spell on the sidelines as his injury is more significant than first feared. Liverpool put together back-to-back wins after Christmas and headed into their clash against the Bees in good form. However, the Reds’ displayed their early season form in north-west London with a worrying display that leaves them trailing Manchester United in fourth by seven points. Though Liverpool have beaten United for the signature of Cody Gakpo who has arrived from PSV to strengthen the Reds’ attack but Jurgen Klopp must now rely on the injury-prone Joel Matip, Joe Gomez and Ibrahima Konate in Van Dijk’s absence as they will be taking on Wolves in the third round of the FA Cup this weekend, before travelling to in-form Brighton in the Premier League.
