The Duke of Sussex, Prince Harry, has claimed that the Prince of Wales, who is his brother, Prince William, physically assaulted him. He made the revelation in his highly-anticipated memoir, Spare, a copy of which was obtained by Guardian UK on Thursday. In the memoir, Harry recounted how his brother grabbed him by the neck and pushed him to the ground. He said their relationship fell apart over his marriage to Meghan Markle. On Thursday, Guardian UK said, “Describing a confrontation at his London home in 2019, Harry says William called Meghan ‘difficult’, ‘rude’ and ‘abrasive’, which Harry calls a ‘parroting of the press narrative’ about his American wife. “The confrontation escalated, Harry writes, until William ‘grabbed me by the collar, ripping my necklace, and… knocked me to the floor.’” Harry claimed that the incident resulted in visible injury to his back. There is stringent pre-launch security around the book, Spare, which is set to be published simultaneously across the globe next week.
