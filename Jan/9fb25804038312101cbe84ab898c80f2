The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA), on Sunday, said it intercepted a consignment of illicit drugs about to be brought into the country by suspected criminals. The Director, Media and Advocacy, NDLEA, Mr Femi Babafemi, said in a statement in Abuja that the suspects used disingenuous modes of concealment to import the consignment. Babafemi said NDLEA operatives also foiled attempts to export drugs to the United Kingdom and the United Arab Emirate through the Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA), Ikeja and Tincan Port in Lagos. He said a freight agent, Ogunsina Damilare, was arrested on Jan. 6, following a bid to export 1.5 kilograms of skunk, hidden in foodstuffs, to Dubai, UAE, through the Skyway Aviation Handling Company. He said the agency also frustrated an attempt to ship to the United Kingdom 11.5kgs of the same substance concealed in a giant wooden sculpture at a courier company in Lagos. The director also said a shipment of 24.5kilograms of cannabis sativa imported to Nigeria from Montreal, Canada was intercepted by operatives at the Tincan Port. “Also, N8 million bribe offered to NDLEA officers by the importer has been secured in an account for the prosecution of the case. “The importer, Cedrick Maduweke, is still at large; one of his accomplices, Steve Isioma Adigwe, has been arrested. “The consignment was hidden in a used Toyota Sienna vehicle that arrived the port along with three other cars in a container marked MSMU 5082733,” he said. Babafemi quoted the Chairman, NDLEA, Brig.-Gen. Buba Marwa (rtd.) as commending the officers and men of Lagos, Kaduna, Kano and Imo Commands for the arrests and seizures. He said Marwa charged the officers and their compatriots across the country to intensify the heat on drug cartels in Nigeria, while balancing their efforts on supply reduction with drug demand reduction activities.
