Ekiti Government says plans are under way to establish the State Sports Commission, as parts of efforts at strengthening sports in the state. Gov. Biodun Oyebanji stated this on Wednesday while receiving the state’s contingent for the 2022 National Sports Festival, held in Delta, in his office in Ado-Ekiti. Oyebanji said as parts of efforts at strengthening the sports sector, his administration would also strengthen the sports laws to ensure that the state athletes were insured and enjoy things that would motivate them to perform maximally. He said that his government would take sports out of the core ministry by establishing a commission that would report directly to him on matters concerning sports development. The governor said in the next 12 months, government, through partnership with one of its bankers, would build a befitting Indoor Games Hall to ease training of athletes. He lauded the state’s contingent to the national sports festival for their zeal and commitment, promising that they would be rewarded for their efforts and performances. Oyebanji assured that the contingent would be appreciated appropriately to motivate them into doing more. Earlier, General Manager of the state Sports Council, Mr Kunle Adeyemi, said that seven out of the 10 contingent that represented the state at the festival won medals in various categories. He called for government’s support for sports development, assuring that more talents could be discovered in the state, if an enabling environment was provided. In his remarks, the Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Youth and Sports Development, Mr Ayodele Adeyanju, appreciated the governor for his support to sports development in the state.
