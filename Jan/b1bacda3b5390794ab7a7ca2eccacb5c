The Presidential Candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, on Saturday inaugurated his presidential campaign in Niger State, promising to complete the Baro inland sea port in the state. Abubakar also promised to tackle insecurity across the country. According to him, “I promise to tackle insecurity and complete the uncompleted Baro inland sea port in Niger state, if you vote for me in the presidential election.” The Baro sea port in Agaie Local Government Area, Niger State, was started in the PDP administration of late President Umaru Yar’adua but is yet to be completed. Abubakar promised to give priority to federal road infrastructure and education sector of the country. The PDP National Chairman, Iyorcha Ayu, also told the people to vote for the party in the 2023 elections based on developmental strides of the former PDP governors of the state; late Alhaji Abdulkadir Kure and Dr Babangida Aliyu. “You have to call the people of Niger State to come out en masse and vote for the PDP because of the massive development you witnessed under past administrations of our party,” Ayu said. The PDP governorship candidate in Niger State, Alhaji Liman Kantigi, also promised to tackle insecurity and give priority to the education sector. Former Babangida Aliyu of Niger State emphasised that a vote for Abubakar in the presidential election is a vote for a better Nigeria. Aliyu enjoined the people of the state to vote for the PDP in the elections in order to ensure a secured, united and a prosperous Nigeria. The PDP State Chairman, Tanko Beji, assured the party that the people of the state would vote for the PDP in the 2023 general elections.
