   There was pandemonium at the U-Turn Bus stop, Abule Egba branch of UBA on Monday 30, 2023 as a result of non-availability of cash for customers. It was observed that despite the CBN extension on swap of old notes to the new redesigned notes, the Oliver Alawuba led UBA couldn’t pay customers with either of the new or old naira Notes. Angry customers vandalized the bank properties when there was neither an over the counter transaction, nor cash from the Automatic teller machine even as there was poor network services to ease banking transactions.
