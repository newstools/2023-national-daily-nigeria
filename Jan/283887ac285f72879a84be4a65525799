 Three men on Friday appeared before a Surulere Chief Magistrates’ Court, Lagos State, on charges of conspiracy, stealing of 500 cartons of Kazu Football worth N62.5 million, and receiving of stoken property. The defendants are Ebere Chukwudumene, 32; Kalu Akwu, 27; and Amechi Nweke, 42. While Nweke is facing charges of conspiracy and stealing, Chukwudumene and Akwu are charged with receiving stolen property. They, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The prosecutor, Insp Christopher Okoliko, told the court that the defendants committed the offences on Jan. 12, about 4:00 p.m. on Opopo St., Surulere. Okoliko alleged that Nweke and another person, still at large, stole 500 cartons of Kazu Football while he worked as a clerk at VCN Sport International. He said that Chukwudumeme and Akwu received the stolen footballs from Nweke. The alleged offences contravene Sections 411, 287 (7) and 328 of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. The News Agency of Nigeria reports that Section 411 stipulates two years’ imprisonment for conspiracy to steal, while 287(7) provides for seven years’ jail term for stealing from one’s employer. The Chief Magistrate, Mrs B. O. Ope-Agbe, granted the defendants bail in the sum of N1 million each with two sureties each in like sum. She directed that the sureties must be gainfully employed and show evidence of tax payment to Lagos State Government. Ope-Agbe adjourned the case until March 10 for mention.
