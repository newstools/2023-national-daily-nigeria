The campaign of the presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Peter Obi, is subtly penetrating the souls of many Nigerians, including those not yet qualified to vote in elections. An Obidient child poured out her emotions for Peter Obi, wishing she could vote in the presidential election. The Obidient Child, displaying her emotions and solidarity, stated: “My daddy, my daddy; my PVC is ready. “I will be thumbing and voting and campaigning till your victory as President.” Unfortunately, the Obidient child, holding the Labour Party flag high above her head, could only campaign through her emotions but cannot vote in the presidential election. The emotions are getting higher and several scenarios are being creating. The child may have sent strong messages to many parents, tentatively, conveying the feelings of other Obidient children, and their expectations from parents.
