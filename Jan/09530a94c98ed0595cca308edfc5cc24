 The Bauchi Emirate Council has removed elder statesman Alhaji (Dr) Muhammadu Bello Kirfi as Council Member and traditional tittle of Wazirin Bauchi for disloyalty and disrespect to the State Governor Bala Mohammed. This was contained in a letter dated January 3, 2023, from the Bauchi Emirate Council. Recall that Kirfi was suspended as the Wazirin Bauchi by the Emir of Bauchi, Dr Rilwanu Suleiman Adamu in 2017 but was subsequently reinstated by Governor Mohammed who presented the letter of reinstatement at Kirfiâ€™s residence in Bauchi on August 5, 2022. Kirfi served as Minister of State Foreign Affairs under President Shehu Shagari and also Minister of Special Duties during the administration of former President Olusegun Obasanjo.
