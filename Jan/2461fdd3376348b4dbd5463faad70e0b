   The Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association (NECA) has raised concerns over increasing tax burden on businesses amid a harsh operating environment in the country. The association particularly alluded to some provisions of the Financial Bill, including the increased Tertiary Education Tax (TET) from 2.5 percent to 3.0 percent. Adewale-Smatt Oyerinde, the Director-General of NECA, in a statement, said the TET was increased without regard for the current economic situation faced by businesses. According to him, organized businesses are currently burdened with over 50 different taxes, levies and fees – both legally and illegally. “These taxes include company income tax; stamp duties; petroleum profit tax; capital gains tax, value added tax; personal income tax; withholding tax; tertiary education tax, among others.

NECA called on President Muhammadu Buhari to request the National Assembly to do the needful by taking into cognizance the concerns of organized businesses and expunge all anti-business provisions in the bill. “It is absurd that the National Assembly will consider and pass the finance bill in an unusual manner. It was surprising that the national assembly would pass such an important bill without the input and contributions of critical stakeholders,” the employers’ body added.
