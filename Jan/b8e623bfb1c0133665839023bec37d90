Actor, Adedimeji Lateef, has revealed that he was once paid as low as five thousand Naira for playing a lead role in a movie. The actor said in a post on his Instagram page on Tuesday as he counts down to his birthday. Going down memory lane, the actor revealed his struggles to make a mark in acting and how he had been discouraged and insulted. He said, “The journey and story of my life was never smooth but this Abeokuta-born and Lagos-bred boy never gave up!
I was just an helpless young boy who does his things and make people laugh unintentionally, to the point that I was picked up in secondary school by a non governmental organisation whose main aim is to train young people majorly through acting, dance and music. Memories of when I gained admission into the university and still didn’t give up, I remember the days I skipped classes to follow this dream of mine, to the year I graduated from UNI 2007/2008 , this stubborn boy still didn’t give up .

Memories of the multiple times I got rejected, insulted, ridiculed and bullied that acting is not my career path and that I’ll never make it in this field that I choose. I remember the times I almost gave up on myself and the career, I remember crying endlessly and told myself it’s better to die. “Memories of the times I walked hours to get on set and rehearsals simply because I had no T-fare. I remember when I had to be a camera boy, wash oga’s cars. Then the times I finally started getting paid 1k, 2k, 5k for a lead role, I remember receiving the payments with so much joy, happiness and gratitude.”
