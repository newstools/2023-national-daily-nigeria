 A 23-year-old student, Patrick Thelwell, accused of throwing four eggs at King Charles III during a visit to York in 2022, has denied threatening behaviour. Thelwell who appeared at York Magistrates Court on Friday charged with a Section 4 public order offence relating to the incident on November 9 also pleaded not guilty to using threatening or abusive words or behaviour. According to Express UK, Thelwell’s counsel, Nicola Hall, argued that his client saw the actions as “necessary” and “part of protest against the establishment”. Hall said that the issues at trial would include whether his actions “were part of legitimate protest” and whether they “looked likely to cause fear of unlawful violence”. Senior District Judge Paul Goldspring released Thelwell on unconditional bail. Trial will commence on April 14 at York Magistrates Court.
