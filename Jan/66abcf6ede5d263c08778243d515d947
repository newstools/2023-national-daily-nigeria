The LP chieftain was billed to fly to London via Virgin Atlantic before he was arrested. Okupe resigned from his role in the LP Presidential Campaign team in December after Justice Ijeoma Ojukwu of a Federal High Court in Abuja on December 19, 2022 found him guilty of receiving over N200 million cash from former National Security Adviser (NSA), Sambo Dasuki, ruling that his action violated the Money Laundering Act. The court held that Okupe was guilty in counts 34, 35, 36, and 59 brought against him by the EFCC and sentenced him to two years imprisonment with an option of a fine. He has since paid the fine.
