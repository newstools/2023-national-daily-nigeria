 National Daily can confirm that Arsenal are definitely pushing to secure the EPL title as boss Mikel Arteta has deemed it fit to bolster his squad following the report that the Gunners are closing in on the €20million signing of Poland international defender Jakub Kiwior from Spezia. Arsenal’s Sporting Director was understood to have flown into Poland last week where he was reported to have held talks over Mykhailo Mudryk’s proposed move to north London. Arsenal were rocked when the Ukraine international subsequently joined Chelsea, but the Arsenal have quickly moved on from that disappointment and are looking to complete a deal for the 22-year-old in the coming days after securing the transfer of Leandro Trossard from Brighton. National Daily learnt from the claim by the renowned Italian journalist Fabrizio Romano that Kiwior, a left-sided centre-half, is set to undergo a medical this weekend with Arsenal and is expected to pen a five-and-a-half year contract at the Emirates.
