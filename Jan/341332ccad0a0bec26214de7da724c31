  Several people were injured and a police officer shot dead on Saturday when gunmen attacked a permanent voter card (PVC) collection centre in Imo state. The attack, which reportedly occurred in Ahiazu Mbaise LGA of Imo state, disrupted the PVC collection exercise as people fled for safety. An official of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), identified as Chienyere Chijioke-Osuji, was said to have confirmed the attack.

No corps member was wounded, though my AEO Ops, Barrister Kingsley Ohiri, and the CLO of the LG dislocated their leg and arm while jumping over the fence,” Chijioke-Osuji was quoted as saying. “Please reach out to Barrister Ohiri. Glory be to God for saving our lives. It’s really unfortunate we lost the chief security officer to the LGA.” The development comes amid recent attacks on INEC offices in parts of the country. Although the electoral commission has expressed concern over the spate of attacks, INEC has said there are no plans to postpone the general election over insecurity.
