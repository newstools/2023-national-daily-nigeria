Cesar Awards, which is France’s most prestigious film awards, has banned nominees accused of sexual assault from attending its ceremony in February. According to Guardian UK on Tuesday, the organisers of the award ceremony which has been dubbed the ‘French Oscars’ announced that anyone being investigated on allegations of sexual misconduct will be barred from its ceremony. In a statement, the Academy said anyone facing a potential prison sentence for “violence, notably of (a) sexual or sexist nature” would be excluded from the coming ceremony. “It has been decided not to highlight people who may have been put in question by the judiciary for acts of violence.” Adding that the step was being taken “out of respect for the victims”, even if they were only “presumed” victims. Before now, there had been fears of protests at the event on 25 February after it was revealed that rising star Sofiane Bennacer was being investigated by police on two allegations of rape and one of violence. Bennacer, 25, who denies any wrongdoing, had been nominated in the Revelation category of the award.
