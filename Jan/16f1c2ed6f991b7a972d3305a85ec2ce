  The Independent Petroleum Marketers Association of Nigeria (IPMAN) has attributed the persistent fuel scarcity in the country to disparity in the price of petrol as different filling stations sell the products above and below N200 per litre. IPMAN’s National Operations Controller, Mike Osatuyi, in a statement on Monday, said the lingering queues at some filling stations were caused by consumers who insisted on buying the fuel at cheaper retail outlets.

No more scarcity, however, the long queues you still see on the expressways is caused by those who want to buy petrol at N180 per litre. Otherwise, those who can afford the more expensive product can easily drive into other stations and buy without queuing up,” Osatuyi said. He added that if all stations comply with the directives by the body to sell petrol at a uniform price, Nigerians will have no choice but to purchase at the same rate and the long queues will disappear.
