Dr Tayo Ojo, a neurosurgeon, who performed the brain surgery for popular Nigerian influencer, Dr Chinonso Egemba aka Aproko Doctor, has been praised for his expertise. The online health influencer had earlier on Monday opened up about his battle with a brain tumour that needed to be taken out. About the surgery, he said that he was advised to travel out of the country but that he opted to have the surgery done in Nigeria and it was done by a Nigerian neurosurgeon. He tweeted a photo of the doctor and said, “It was Dr. Tayo Ojo, a neurosurgeon here in Nigeria, that did the surgery. So many people begged me to leave the country and get the surgery done but something kept me back here because I still had trust in us. We just need more investment in our health sector.” Netizens have been hailing Dr Ojo and sharing how he saved their lives or those of their relatives. An Instagram user, Jane Michael, said, “This is the doctor that saved my mum from brain tumour in LUTH. Former reality TV star, Leo Da Silva, tweeted, “I know of this man, brilliant and exceptional.” Favouritethings tweeted, “Dr. Ojo is the angel that saved my life from brain aneurysm in September 2022 too. Such a kind man. I was already bleeding into my brain before I got to LUTH on 9/9/2022. Here I am, recovering and grateful to be alive. Nigeria has hope if we can support our doctors.” B Emmanuel tweeted his own encounter with Dr Ojo saying, “I am a neurofibromatosis patient, He did a spine surgery for me too at LUTH. He also assist(ed) Dr Ugboro in doing a skin-grafting surgery of the foot for me, I so much love that man.” Sola Baloo tweeted, “Wow! Same Dr Tayo Ojo did my father’s brain surgery in 2019, and my old man is doing just great.”
