    Manchester United star Antony who was involved in a car crash on New Year’s Eve has described the experience as shocking. National Daily learnt that the Brazilian winger who made an £85 million summer signing to Old Trafford from Ajax last summer escaped unhurt after he smashed his BMW X6 into roadworks on the M56, just hours after he played in United’s 1-0 win over Wolves at Molineaux. Subsequently, the 22-year-old was left out of the squad for United’s 3-0 win over Bournemouth on Tuesday, but returned for the 3-1 win over Everton in the FA Cup on Friday. And speaking after the game, the winger meanwhile did not elaborate on the accident but described the crash as a ‘shock’. ‘First of all it’s a feeling of joy, I’m happy to score again and especially at home. I’ve set some goals for me this season and it’ good to score as soon as I’ve start to think of personal goals. But of course the most important is United’s qualification,’ Antony told TNT Sports after United’s win over Everton. ‘I also feel relieved as in the last few days I had a shock, but I prefer not to comment on what happened. It was a personal matter, really hard but I’m very grateful to God for putting this behind me now. ‘Grateful to the club, to the players, to the manager to everyone that stayed by my side. It’s in the past now, I’m happy to score and I hope to keep going lie this because this is a year of a lot of achievements and wins. ‘This is my mind-frame now, I’m 100% focused on honouring the fans and the club. We all know the size of this club we want to put United back where it deserves. ‘It was a really, really difficult moment for me. But God has always been by my side and I’m grateful also to my family. I dedicate this goal to them and it’s in moments like these that you know who really loves you.’ A source told The Sun: ‘It was dark and wet and he made an error of judgement. ‘He was shook up but thankfully no one else was involved and he wasn’t injured.’
