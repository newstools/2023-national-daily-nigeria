Nollywood actor, Yomi Gold, has said that his marriage to his wife, Amina, has crashed. He got married to Amina in January 2022. The actor revealed the marriage crash via his Instagram account on Tuesday, saying that his estranged wife is a good person, who deserves someone better than him. He said, “Me and Meenah decided to go our separate ways. I want all our families, friends, fans to understand. This is no time to judge anyone. When love dies in a relationship. No one should force it. I want to use this time to thank everyone who has been very concerned and supportive. “Meenah is a good person. She doesn’t deserve a man like me. She will make a great and loving partner to a far better person than me. I am not perfect. I will work on myself and be a better person. “This has to be published because we want everyone who knows about us to be aware of our decision. Time will be good again.”
