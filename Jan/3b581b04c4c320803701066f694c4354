   The Presidential Candidate of the Labour Party (LP), Mr Peter Obi, paid about N1 million to offset the medical bill of Mrs Blessing Usulor, a resident of Enugu, abandoned in a hospital. Usulor, in June 2022, was rushed to the Hopecare Medical Centre, Enugu by her neighbours when she slumped in her quarters within the IMT Campus-4 axis of Enugu. Presenting a cheque on Wednesday to the Medical Director of the Centre, Obi, who was represented by Ambassador Bianca Ojukwu, extolled the hospital management for putting life first before monetary consideration in terms of payment of deposit. He said that the exemplary conduct of the hospital by seeing to the survival and total recovery of the patient showed “the New Nigeria we all are yearning for”. According to him, the recovery of Usulor and the exemplary conduct of Hopecare Medical Centre is a shining example that with love and care, Nigerians have the capacity to rebuild this great country once more.

Responding, the Medical Director of the Centre, Dr Samuel Ngwu, said that she was admitted in June 2022 and was brought to the hospital in a coma by neighbours living within her quarters. Ngwu noted that she stayed in a coma for a whole 10 days and her medical case was with some complications. According to him, these complications include renal failure, which involved the hospital carrying out dialysis, diabetes complications and eventually she also developed ulcers due to a long stay in bed. “While in the hospital all this time, she lives on handouts from other patients or relatives of other patients she meets in the ward. Earlier, today, a relative of a patient gave her N3,000,” he said. The medical director thanked Obi for the gesture, adding that “we are looking forward to a New Nigeria, where we will be led by leaders with vision like Mr Peter Obi.” In a tearful mood, Usulor, who hails from Ebonyi, appreciated Obi for identifying with “a poor and nobody” in the society. “I am overwhelmed with joy that I don’t know how to thank His Excellence for this kind gesture and remembering someone that has been abandoned. “I appreciate Dr. Samuel Ngwu and the entire management of Hopecare Medical Centre that God has used to keep me alive till today. May God continue to bless and reward you all,” she added.
