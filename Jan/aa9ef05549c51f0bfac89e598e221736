The security agencies have also continued to assure Nigerians that they are working tirelessly to ensure that the elections are held in a peaceful atmosphere.” The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) raised alarm over the threat of cancellation of the 2023 general election due to the rising security challenges across the country. This was made known on Monday by the Chairman of INEC, Professor Mahmood Yakubu while speaking at the validation of election security training resources held in Abuja, where he analyzed the impact of the security situation on the forthcoming election, noting that it faces a serious threat of cancellation should the insecurity across the country fail to improve. Yakubu, who was represented by the Chairman of the Board of Electoral Institute, Abdullahi Zuru, explained, saying: “If the insecurity is not monitored and dealt with decisively, it could ultimately culminate in the cancellation and/or postponement of elections in sufficient constituencies to hinder declaration of election results and precipitate a constitutional crisis.”
