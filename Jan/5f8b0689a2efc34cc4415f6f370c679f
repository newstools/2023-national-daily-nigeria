  A member of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Board of Trustees (BoT), Prince Benjamin Apugo, has resigned from the party. Apugo who resigned from the ruling party to drum up support for the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Mr Peter Obi, said that his integrity, competence and proven track record of achievements have put him ahead of other contenders of the seat. In a media chat on Saturday accused the APC-led Federal Government of neglecting Abia State, saying there is no federal presence in the state. “APC has not done anything for Umuahia and Abia State where I come from”, he regretted. He also said that the APC had not done much for Ndigbo, and urged voters to vote based on the competence and integrity of candidates and not for the party logo in the forthcoming polls.
