    Chelsea who completed the transfer of Lyon star Malo Gusto have spent £200m this month, having splurged close to £300m last summer. The Stamford Bridge club appeared to have a genuine plan to revamp the west London club and have seen them committed to series of transfer following the arrival of David Fofana from Molde. The Blues have also captured Ivorian Benoit Badiashile from Norwegian side Molde, Andrey Santos from Vasco da Gama. Other arrivals were Jaoo Felix from Atletico Madrid, Mykhailo Mudryk from Shakhtar Donetsk and Noni Madueke from PSV Eindhoven. Now Chelsea latest signing Gusto has revealed that Chelsea are a ‘very big club’ and that he was persuaded to join them over Manchester United because they are a ‘very big club’ with a wonderful project. National Daily can confirm that the right-back has completed his move to the Stamford Bridge last weekend, after Chelsea agreed to Lyon’s demand that the defender remains at the club for the remainder of the season. The move, worth an initial £30.7m with £4.5m in add-ons, will give Chelsea competition for first choice right-back Reece James. National Daily learnt that Gusto, 19, was on the radar of a host of top European clubs but Chelsea struck quickly this month to secure his signature. After being alerted to Chelsea’s move for Gusto, Manchester United made contact with the defender’s representatives. The Red Devils had identified Gusto as a replacement for Aaron Wan-Bissaka but they had plotted to make a move this summer.
