A local community was thrown into panic as bandits struck, kidnapping a retired Colonel, Rabi’u Garba, identified as former Commandant of the Zamfara State Road Traffic Regulatory Agency (ZAROTA), together with his two children at Gusau-Tsafe Road in Zamfara State. The victim was said to be returning to home in Yandoto with his two children on New year day, last Sunday, when they were intercepted and kidnapped. The locals were said to have narrated: “we heard gunshots and started running into the bush for fear of the Terrorists but we later discovered that Colonel Rabius Garba retired was their target, and they whisked him and two of his children away.” The Police were said to have deployed tactical operatives on search and rescue operations in the surrounding forest.
