New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has announced that she will step down from the role by February 7. Ardern made the surprise announcement during her first press conference of 2023 on Thursday. “I know what this job takes, and I know that I no longer have enough in the tank. It’s that simple,” she said. “We give all that we can for as long as we can, and then it’s time. And for me, it’s time.” Her resignation will take effect on the appointment of a new prime minister. A caucus vote to elect a new Labour Party leader will take place on Saturday. Elected prime minister in 2017 at 37 years, Ardern is one of the world’s youngest female heads of government and the second to become a mother while still in office. Ardern also announced this year’s election will be held on Oct. 14.
