  The Supreme Court has dismissed two appeals brought before it by Otunba Jimi Adebisi Lawal, a claimant to the governorship ticket of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in Ogun state. Lawal is challenging the nomination of Oladipupo Adebutu as the PDP gubernatorial candidate in Ogun State. The two appeals were dismissed by Justice Kudirat Kekere-Ekun following their withdrawal by the appellant’s counsel, Chukwudi Enebeli. Jimi Lawal’s suit challenging Adebutu had earlier been dismissed at the High Court and the Court of Appeal. This cleared the way for Adebutu to fly the banner of the PDP at the March 11, 2023 governorship election in the state. Displeased with the verdicts of the lower courts, Lawal challenged the use of the Court Record transmitted by another party and the procedural policy in accepting and using the disputed record.
