A 29-year-old former Playboy model, Kelsey Turner, has been sentenced to 10 to 25 years in prison for murdering her 71-year-old lover after he broke up with her and stop paying her bills. Kelsey was sentenced on Tuesday, January 10, by a Clark County, Nevada for the 2019 m¥urder of California psychiatrist, Thomas Burchard. The convict took an Alford plea — in which she agreed she’d be found guilty at trial but maintained her innocence — in November 2022 to the second-degree mrder of the deceased. Fox News reports that Turner and her then-boyfriend, 29-year-old Jon Logan Kennison, were arrested in 2019 after authorities found Burchard’s body stuffed in the trunk of an abandoned car on State Route 147 near Lake Mead outside Las Vegas on March 7 of that year.
