A 40-year-old man, Musa Babangida, who allegedly issued illegal stickers to motorcyclists, has been arraigned in Lagos State. The defendant is standing trial before an Ojo Magistratesâ€™ Court on a count charge of breach of peace. He, however, pleaded not guilty to the charge before Magistrate L.J.K. Layeni. The prosecutor, Dr Simon Uche, told the court that the defendant committed the offence on Jan. 20 at the NEPA area of Alaba Rago in Ojo. He alleged that the defendant engaged in printing stickers for commercial motorcyclists with his full names, authorising them to ply expressways. According to him, the act is contrary to the Lagos State law prohibiting commercial motorcyclists from operating on highways. The prosecutor said that the conduct of the defendant can cause breach of peace and contravenes Section 168 (d) of the Criminal Law of Lagos State, 2015. Layeni granted the defendant bail in the sum of N100,000 with one surety in like sum. He adjourned the case until March 1 for trial.
