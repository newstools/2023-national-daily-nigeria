She also charged Nigerians to get their PVCs and vote rightly in the forthcoming election. She wrote: “This is the summary of the HOPELESS Budget @MBuhari signed into Law yesterday: Total Expenditure is N21.83 Trillion. Total Revenue N9.73 Trillion! The Budget has a Deficit larger than Revenue by almost N12.00 Trillion! Tragic. You all better get your PVCs ready. “I foresaw this historical mess-up of our Public Finance by the @NigeriaGov of @NGRPresident @MBuhari and persistently spoke up. At all times, the Government and its praise singers replied to my data-based criticisms with attacks. Now a full blown Debt Crisis on our hands. Sad. “Recall that one of cardinal plans of the Presidential Candidate of the @OfficialAPCNg is “to delink Expenditure from Revenue” and some of you were like, better known that from the current state of our Public Finance, APC @NigeriaGov has already done so. Get and use your PVCs.”
