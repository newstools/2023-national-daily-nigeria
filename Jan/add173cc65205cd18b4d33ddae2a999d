Gov Darius Ishaku of Taraba on Tuesday urged the Independent National Electoral Commision (INEC) to insist on the use of the Bimodal Voter Accreditation System (BVAS) to save the people’s Democratic Party PDP and Nigerians from election riggers. Ishaku stated this while speaking at the inauguration of the state PDP Gubernatorial Campaign Council in Jalingo. The governor recalled that the Osun governorship election was an indication that Nigerians were dearly in need of a PDP administration to reshape the country for better development and unity of the people. According to him, the tribunal judgment against Gov. Ademola Adeleke was a mere miscarriage of justice, saying BVAS would be used as evidence by the higher courts to quash the judgment. “I call on every citizens of Taraba to stay clear from any form of election violence as the security would deal decisively with anyone caught in the act. “The Osun governorship election is a proof and an indication that Nigerians need a PDP administration to reshape the country and unite the people for better development. “For us in Taraba, our campaign is going to be a door to door campaign and I believe that our physical projects would convince the people to vote for Atiku as President, Agbu as governor and all the national and state houses of assembly candidates,” he said. Alhaji Amino Jika, the Director-General of the council, assured the people that his team would mentain the PDP winning status in the state as it had been doing since the return to democracy in 1999.
