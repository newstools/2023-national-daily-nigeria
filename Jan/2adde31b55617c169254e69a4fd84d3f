Former United States (US) President Donald Trump on Wednesday sustained his mobilization of the far-right Republicans to end their blocking votes and support the Republican candidate, Kevin McCarthy, for Speaker of the US House of Representatives. The House ended the second day of internal election without a speaker emerging. It was noted that the House of Representatives had failed for the first time in a century to elect a speaker on resumption after elections. Trump posted on Wednesday: “It’s now time for all of our great Republican House Members to vote for Kevin, close the deal and take victory. “Republicans, do not turn a great triumph into a giant and embarrassing defeat.” It was gathered that McCarthy needs 218 votes in the House, but there was a narrow 222-212 Republican majority after 2022 midterm elections. McCarthy had been given a condition for support by the far-right Republicans which he was yet to concede, leading to blocking votes from the Republicans of 19 “no” votes in each of the first two rounds, rising to 20 in the third. After adjournment on Tuesday to Wednesday, the House failed to elect a new Speaker. McCarthy, who ignored a subpoena from the special House panel investigating the 2021 assault by Trump supporters on the Capitol, has already threatened investigations of President Joe Biden administration, his family, including the FBI and CIA. McCarthy is perceived to be strongly leaning towards the extreme right, creating the fear that he may alienate moderates. However, trump is making a strong case for McCarthy to emerge the next Speaker of US House, while he prepares for the next presidential election.
