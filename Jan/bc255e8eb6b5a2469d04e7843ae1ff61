Gov. Wike Rivers Deputy Speaker, Ehie Ogerenye Edison, has said a woman who was experiencing difficult labour gave birth after calling Governor Nyesom Wike’s name. According to him, “As of yesterday night, there was a lady in labour. The lady tried but she couldn’t put to bed. They had already prepared the theatre for her to be operated on this morning. But because the nurses knew that you are coming to Ahodia today, they were discussing that ‘our executive governor is coming to Ahodia today; this man likes Ahoada people’. At the hearing of your name, the woman shouted ‘the God of Nyesom Wike, let me deliver safely’. Three times, the woman mentioned your name; she delivered a bouncing baby boy. Your excellency, that was your name. They came this morning, saying they want to name the boy in your name. I said ‘no, don’t do that until I hear confirmation from his excellency.”
