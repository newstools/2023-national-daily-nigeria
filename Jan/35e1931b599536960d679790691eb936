  The Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, has replied to the comment made by the Presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) describing the former Anambra state governor as a stingy man unfit to govern Nigeria. It would be recalled that Tinubu had during a campaign outing in Akure, Ondo State, berated Obi and described his leadership philosophy as inimical to Nigeria’s development. “All Obi could do was boast that he saved money. But I tell you it is a wicked parent that holds money in his hand yet allows his children to starve. My people, you cannot entrust your future or that of our nation to Mr Sell Everything Atiku or Mr Stingy Obi. But you can trust Mr Progressive Good Governance Tinubu!” Tinubu had said. Obi, who addressed supporters during a campaign rally in Akure, Ondo state capital on Saturday, said the country would be better off in the hands of a prudent president.

We want to make sure we use your money to transform the country. “This election that is coming now, don’t vote for anybody because of the tribe but vote for someone that will move the country forward. “This election is about character and people we can trust.
