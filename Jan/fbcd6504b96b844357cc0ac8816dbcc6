 Ambulance workers commenced renewed strike in England and Wales on Monday, adding to the strike action by nurses in public health institutions. Ambulance workers had commenced industrial action on December 21, 2022, planning further dates for February. Nurses also gave impetus to industrial action, protesting dissatisfaction with state-funded National Health Service, where the workers are struggling with rising living costs. Before the industrial action on Monday, there had been plan for mass simultaneous strikes on February 6 involving unions representing both nurses and ambulance staff. The strike on Monday involved members of three unions,  Unison, Unite and GMB,  in England and Wales. Unison, UK’s largest trade union, was cited to have said that about 15,000 ambulance staff in England would be striking along with 5,000 members at hospitals in Liverpool in northwest England. Unite said more than 2,600 of its ambulance worker members were striking in England and Wales, following a three-day strike last week. Unite general secretary, Sharon Graham, was said to have stated: “We’re trying to get the government to negotiate. “It’s been five weeks since Unite ambulance workers were out and in that time, there has been literally no meeting about the substantive issue of pay. “There are absolutely no pay talks going ahead, it’s wrong to suggest that they are.” She complained that Prime Minister Rishi Sunak is “missing in action” and “needs to get more involved.” Some of the GMB members at one ambulance service in central England striking this Monday, were said to have declared:  : “We need to talk pay. We’re ready when you are.” The London Ambulance Service, however, urged people to only call the 999 emergency number in “life-threatening” situations, warning that the public they “may be asked to organise transport to hospital”.
