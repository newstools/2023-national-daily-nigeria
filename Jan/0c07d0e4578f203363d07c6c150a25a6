  The former Director-General of the Labour Party Presidential Campaign Council, Doyin Okupe, has been reportedly arrested by the Department of State Services (DSS) at the Muritala Mohammed International Airport, Lagos. One of Okupe’s lawyers, Tolu Babaleye, stated this on Facebook on Thursday. Babaleye said Okupe was on his way to London when he was arrested. He claimed that the DSS asked him to provide court processes where he paid the fine option following his money laundering conviction by the Federal High Court, Abuja. “The reason according to source is that he was asked to produce evidence that the Federal High Court Abuja has freed him from the case in which he was convicted and paid fine to the knowledge of the whole world and was allowed to go home. “When will this harassment stop? Who is after Dr. Okupe? As of today, the man has no case to answer, I hereby demand that the DSS should release my client immediately as this is a violation of his freedom of movement, right to liberty and dignity of human person. This is unfair as the man’s health is fast failing,” he stated.
