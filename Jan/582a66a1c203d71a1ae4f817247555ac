An Ibadan-based building materials dealer, Aishat Zakaria, has accused her husband, Taofeek, of forcing her to observe marathon fasting when she was pregnant. According to the News Agency of Nigeria on Friday, Zakaria, who was seeking dissolution of her marriage, told a Mapo Grade ‘A’ Customary Court in Ibadan that her husband maltreats her. ”He beats me and inflicts cuts on my body,” she alleged. Delivering the verdict, the President of the Court, Mrs S.M. Akintayo granted the petitioner’s request for dissolution. She held that the petitioner’s application had merit since the marriage was valid via a customary process, based on the evidence tendered by the petitioner and asked Taofeek to take full responsibility for their children’s feeding, schooling and other welfare.
