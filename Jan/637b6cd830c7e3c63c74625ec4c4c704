   President Muhammadu Buhari on Monday unveiled the Lekki Deep Sea Port, the largest in Nigeria and in Sub-Saharan Africa. The multi-purpose Deep Sea Port offers enormous support to the burgeoning commercial operations across Nigeria and the entire West African region. The unveiling of the Port is part of Buhari’s project inauguration in Lagos. Buhari did not speak before and after unveiling the project. He, however, took a brief inspection trip around the project to inspect the facilities. Speaking at the event, Lagos State Governor, Babajide Sanwo-Olu, said the Lekki Deep Sea Port is a total combination of the efforts of the Federal Government, Lagos State Government and the private sector.
