The Duke of Sussex, Prince Harry, has expressed a willingness to heal the strained relationship between him and his father, King Charles III, as well as his brother, Prince William. He said this in the trailer of the interview he had with ITV’s Tom Bradby which was published on Monday. He said, “It never needed to be this way. The leaking and the planting. I want a family, not an institution. If they feel as though it’s better to keep us somehow as the villains. They have shown absolutely no willingness to reconcile.” “I would like to get my father back. I would like to have my brother back,” he added in the trailer. Harry and his wife, Meghan Markle left the royal family in 2020 to start a new life in America. Harry’s interview is set to be published on Sunday, same day as the one he had with CBS 60 Minutes. They are to promote his new memoir, Spare.
