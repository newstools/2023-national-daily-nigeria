  Reports reaching National Daily reveal that Arsenal have made Declan Rice their top summer transfer target and the north London club are confident they can sign the West Ham United star ahead of rivals Chelsea. It is understood that the Hammers are expected to sell Rice at the end of the season with the midfielder unwilling to sign a new contract in east London. And while Manchester United were interested in a deal last summer before backing away from West Ham’s £150million valuation, Chelsea are believed to have long been considered the favourites to sign the 24-year-old who came from their academy when he does leave the London Stadium. The England international played in the Chelsea academy until the age of 14 and is a lifelong Blues supporter, also best friends with Mason Mount.
