The naira has dropped to N760 per dollar at the parallel section of the foreign exchange (FX) market, popularly called the black or street market. The figure represents a depreciation of N20 or 1.1 percent from the N740 it traded two weeks ago. Bureaux De Change (BDC) operators put the buying price of the dollar at N740 and the selling price at N760, leaving an N20 profit margin. They said there was low demand for the greenback in the street market. READ ALSO: Banks suspend transactions via Naira credit, prepaid cards “Demand is not much. Maybe because it’s January.
