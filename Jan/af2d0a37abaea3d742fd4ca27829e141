  Napoli on Friday night left their fans in a thrilling mood after smashing their rivals Juventus 5-1 to make a clear statement for the Serie A title as they open a ten-point lead on top of the table. There is no doubt that Gli Azzurri fans will remember this game for a long time as they put five past an in-form Juventus who had only shipped seven goals all season. Victor Osimhen who got a brace had opened the scoring as early as the 14th minute with Khvicha Kvaratskhelia, Rrahmani and Elmas also getting in on the score sheet as Luciano Spalletti’s side extended their lead with double digit. It was indeed a brilliant performance from Napoli as apart from a brief spell at the end of the first half when Juve were on top, it was a dominant performance from Luciano Spalletti’s side. Osimhen and Khvicha Kvaratskhelia form a lethal pair and it’s imperative that they remain injury-free. Mario Rui looked excellent, especially in the first half and Anguissa was a rock in the centre of the park for Napoli.
