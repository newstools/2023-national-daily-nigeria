Rescue is underway, we don’t know right now if there are survivors,” the Yeti Airlines’ spokesman Sudarshan Bartaula told AFP. He said the plane crashed between the old and new Pokhara airports in central Nepal. The wreckage was on fire and rescue workers were trying to put out the blaze, said local official Gurudutta Dhakal.
