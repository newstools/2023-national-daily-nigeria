The strike embarked on by Ground Handlers of the Nigerian Aviation Handling Company (NAHCO) at the Murtala Muhammed International Airport, Lagos, crippled activities on Monday, causing cancellation of flights. Several international passengers were stranded as the workers commenced the industrial action on Monday. The airport workers are protesting poor condition of service and demanding increase in salaries and improvement in other welfare conditions. The management of NAHCO was said to have approached the court and obtained an injunction restraining the workers from going on strike. One of the union members of the Air Transport Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (ATTSSSAN), was said to have disclosed that the strike was called by the workers, not the union. The National Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE) had in a statement last week directed its members to withdraw services from the airport. According to the strike notice, “In the above regard, all NAHCO staff are hereby directed to withdraw services with effect from Monday 23, 2023. This action shall be definite until otherwise directed by the secretariats of the unions.”
