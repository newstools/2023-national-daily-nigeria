The presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, at the party’s presidential campaign in Uyo, Akwa Ibom State, ridiculed the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), former Vice President Atiku Abubakar. Tinubu, like he mocked President Muhammadu Buhari, Vice President Yemi Osinbajo SAN, in Abeokuta, Ogun State, before the APC national convention,  said Nigerians are not going to give Atiku their votes again [after he had failed in several elections]. Tinubu declared, “He faced Obasanjo, and he failed. Buhari, he failed. He failed with Jonathan. He failed all classes.” Tinubu also said that he rescued Atiku Abubakar from former President Olusegun Obasanjo, when the former President wanted to roast him like goat. He further declared: “They have no mandate; what they have is ice cream. It melted quickly. They are yeye people. Atiku, when we made him [vice] president – you said this, you said that… “Assets, our commonwealth, our patrimony, everything that we have, you sold it. We became skeletons. Atiku didn’t care – as vice president. I am the one who rescued him from Obasanjo who wanted to roast him like goat meat. “The Niger Delta youths, you begged that time. He ran away to Dubai. “When elections came again, he came for stomach infrastructure. He came to us in Lagos; we rehabilitated him and gave him the ticket. “What did he do with it? He used it to collect money, wasted our ticket, and went back to Dubai. “This time around, we said we are tired, we are not going to give you our vote again. He faced Obasanjo, and he failed. Buhari, he failed. He failed with Jonathan. He failed all classes.” He urged the people of Akwa Ibom State not to vote for Atiku and the PDP in the 2023 elections.
