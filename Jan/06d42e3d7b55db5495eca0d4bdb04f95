Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State appears to be getting more restless over the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, towards the 2023 general elections. After the Rivers governor had declined campaigning for the PDP presidential candidate, in collaboration with his allies, the G5, and others, the governor had persistently been lashing out at the PDP presidential candidate who has been conducting his presidential campaign peacefully across the country. Governor Wike at the PDP campaign in Bonny for state candidates, stated: “I can’t force myself to campaign for you when you have not asked for it. “These ones have told me, so, I’ve come here to campaign. If somebody asks you to work for him, you’ll work for him. But if they don’t want you to work for them, will you force them?” He had maintained: “any person who says Rivers State is not important, we will pepper him. Anybody who says he doesn’t regard Rivers State, we would not regard such person. “There’s nothing like propaganda, nothing like intimidation because nobody can intimidate us. We are very, very solid. We are very strong. “No state can point at us to determine what will happen here. Nobody can do such. So, be bold to say, I’m from Rivers State, I live in Rivers and I am happy with Rivers. What is important is our State which we have collected.” Source: Channels TV
