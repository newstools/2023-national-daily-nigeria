 The Minister of Labour & Employment Dr. Chris Ngige, has berated those criticizing President Buhari’s administration. Ngige, who spoke to journalists in his hometown of Alor, Idemili South LGA of Anambra State on Wednesday, said that the current administration should not be blamed for the country’s food & energy crises because they are occurring all over the world, not just in Nigeria. “President Buhari ought to be praised, but they will tell you that people are dying of hunger. Hunger is a global problem. If you go to the news, you will see white people protesting against hunger and the high cost of living in Europe and elsewhere,” he said. Ngige cautioned that Buhari shouldn’t be held accountable for everything that has gone awry “under the sun” & that he should be left alone. “Disregard those politicians who will come & tell you that the Buhari administration inflicted hardship and poverty on you,” he said.
