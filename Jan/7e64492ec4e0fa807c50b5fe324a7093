  Acquisition talks between Access Holdings and Centum Investment Plc have collapsed as the Nigerian and Kenyan companies failed to agree on conditions to finalise the buyout of 83.4 per cent stake in Sidian Bank. Both companies were on the negotiating table for Centum Investment’s 83.4 percent controlling stake in Sidian Bank which is worth N15 billion. In a statement released in June 2022, Access Holdings stated that the company had agreed to purchase Sidian Bank for N15 billion. However, in a reverse statement dated January 12, 2023, Access Holdings said its subsidiary, Access Bank, will no longer merge with Sidian as previously disclosed seven months ago.
