Also speaking, a Senior Executive Director of the Foundation, Pastor Olajumoke Akinsanya said in the last ten years, FALF has identified over hundred youths who have the potential to be remarkable leaders within their communities and nations. “The foundation fosters these young leaders through training and support initiatives aimed at helping them to achieve their full ability and to use their leadership skills to improve the lives of others. “This program seeks to recognize, promote and award young men and women whose exemplary leadership skills have been utilized in developing solutions to issues addressed in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals: no poverty, no hunger, quality healthcare, quality education, gender equality, sanitation and hygiene, renewable energy, jobs and economic growth in Africa.” Speaking on the impacts, the 2022 star prize winner, 22-year-old Lebsey Petmia from Cameroon, whose ground breaking projects in deepening primary health-care for the vulnerable various communities, said the award would propel her to do more for her people. “I watch lots of people die from treatable diseases simply because they lack access to healthcare. Even my elder brother died from a minor complication from anaemia. So I decided towards making this primary healthcare available by training locals from various communities in Cameroon. “With this award and the voice it has given me, I’ll advocate for better health policies in Cameroon, especially in the area of health insurance for the less privileged,” she added. The 2021 star prize winner, Nervis Nzometiah Tetsop, also from Cameroon said being a star prize winner of the prestigious awards has opened greater doors for him in the last one year.
