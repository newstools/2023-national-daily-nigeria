Guinea-Bissau on Friday announced the renaming of the country’s stadium in the second city, Bafata, as “Pele Stadium” to honour the late Brazilian football legend. The government of Guinea Bissau, West African, in a statement disclosed that the decision was made at a cabinet meeting after observing a minute’s silence in memory of Pele, who died on December 29 at age 82. The stadium has a capacity of about 15,000 seats. Bafata is about 150 kilometres (90 miles) east of the capital, Bissau.
