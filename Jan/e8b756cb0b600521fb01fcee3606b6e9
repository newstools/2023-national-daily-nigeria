However, the social critic argued that since President Muhammadu Buhari had not officially increased the price of PMS, the major oil marketers should be held accountable. He wrote: “It’s evident that the FG or the NNPCL has not officially increased the pump price of petrol. The major marketers unilaterally did that. They are also the architect of the shortages. It’s time to call them out. What’s the use of subsidy with this outrageous price?”
