   The fans at Stamford Bridge are in celebration mood over the latest update regarding their major transfer target Enzo Fernandez. Latest report reaching National Daily from Portugal reveals that the midfielder is now pushing to join Chelsea from Benfica before the end of the January transfer window. The development will definitely elate the Blues fans as Chelsea have been negotiating with Benfica for several weeks but have been unable to agree a deal with the Portuguese club for Argentina’s World Cup winner. Benfica have been adamant that Chelsea must pay Fernandez’s €120 million (£105.4m) release clause and the Premier League club’s attempt to meet that figure by offering the fee in instalments has been rejected. Fernandez, meanwhile, was disciplined by Benfica earlier this month as he attempted to force his move to Chelsea by missing two training sessions and returning to Argentina for New Year celebrations without permission. The midfielder then appeared to signal that he wanted to stay with his celebration in front of Benfica’s supporters after scoring in their Portuguese Cup win over Varzim. However, Record reports that Fernandez has had another change of heart and has indicated to Benfica that he wants to join Chelsea before the window closes on Tuesday evening. The report also claims that members of Chelsea’s hierarchy are now travelling to Lisbon in order to negotiate directly with Benfica, similar to how they secured a deal ahead of Arsenal for Mykhailo Mudryk earlier this month. Meanwhile, The Telegraph reports that Chelsea believe they can reach an agreement with Benfica before Tuesday’s deadline. When asked last week if he believes Fernandez will remain at Benfica, head coach Roger Schmidt said: ‘Yes, of course. ‘When you see Enzo playing you can tell he’s in shape and happy. He’s not thinking about anything else. ‘I’m not expecting to lose any of the starters. I see the players concentrated and I hope this continues.’
