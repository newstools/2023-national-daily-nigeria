     National Daily can confirm that Chelsea top midfielder Jorginho is set to cross over to the north side of London after Arsenal agreed a £12 million fee with the Blues for the Italian. It is understood that Mikel Arteta is desperate to bolster his squad with a new central midfielder before the January transfer window closes on Tuesday evening. National Daily learnt that the Gunners have made Moises Caicedo their priority target but two bids – including a £70 million offer – have been rejected by Brighton so far. Accordingly, Arsenal are exploring alternative options and a lower-cost solution would be signing Jorginho from Chelsea. The Italy international has entered the final six months of his contract but it’s understood that Chelsea were holding out for a £15m to £20m transfer fee. National Daily gathered from The report by the Athletic, that a £12m agreement has now been agreed between Arsenal and Chelsea, and the 31-year-old is due to travel to the Gunners’ training ground on Tuesday to finalise his move. The report claims that Jorginho will sign a contract with Arsenal until 2024 and it will include the option to extend a further year. Chelsea, meanwhile, remain in talks with Benfica to sign Enzo Fernandez. Argentina’s World Cup winner is keen to make the move to Stamford Bridge before the deadline but Chelsea are struggling to agree a fee with Benfica, who want the Premier League club to pay the midfielder’s €120m (£105.4m) release clause.
