The presidential candidate of the Labour Party (LP) in the 2023 general elections, Peter Obi, at a campaign in Ekiti State, told Nigerians to reject moneybag politicians in the February 25 presidential election.  A renown legal practitioner, Afe Babalola, had expressed the view that the highest spender will win the 2023 presidential election, not the best candidate. Obi had a counter view, declaring, “Moneybags have played a lot of roles but they brought us to poverty.” Obi further declared, “It is time to reject them. I am pleading for Nigerians to reject them because they cannot continue. If they continue, we are going to be impoverished.”  Obi also expressed that he is the most qualified of the 18 presidential candidates for the February election, expressing gratitude to Ekiti people for their turnout at the campaign venue. He assured that there is hope for a new Nigeria. Obi in a tweet on his official twitter handle wrote: Peter Obi @PeterObi “Thank you Ekiti OBIdients for an awesome outing, and show of love. I wish to reiterate my very special thanks to Ewi of Ado-Ekiti, Oba Adeyemo Adejugbe, and his council of chiefs, Afe Babalola (SAN), the Management of Afe Babalola University Ekiti. “There is hope for a new Nigeria. A national rebirth is POssible!” -PO
