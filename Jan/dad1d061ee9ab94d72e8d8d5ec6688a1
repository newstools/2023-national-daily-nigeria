    Premier League giants Liverpool are set lose their transfer target Milan Skriniar to Paris Saint-Germain as the defender plans to quit Inter Milan, with National Daily gathering that the Ligue 1 giants are in the pole position to secure his signature as his contract expires at the end of the season. National Daily understands that the Slovakia international  has remained a mainstay in the heart Inter’s defence since his rival from Sampdoria in 2017. The 28-year-old has made 242 appearances for the Italian giants and captained the side, but his time in Milan appears to be over. Despite Inter wanting Skriniar to sign a new deal, he has chosen not to and will now move on at the end of the season, or possibly before the end of the month if an offer comes in and Inter choose to cash in. With great experience and still plenty of years ahead of him, there is no shortage of interest in the Slovakian from big clubs across Europe. Transfer expert Fabrizio Romano, for Caught Offside, reports that Paris Saint-Germain are leading the race to sign the defender, ahead of a string of Premier League clubs. The likes of Liverpool, Tottenham, Newcastle and Chelsea have all been linked with Skriniar and are all able to make offers to him now to join in the summer. Talks have reportedly already been held between the centre-back and PSG and the French club have made good progress, but Premier League sides could still swoop for the Slovakian. PSG may choose to seal the deal this month by paying a fee for Skriniar rather than wait to get him on a free transfer in the summer. Gazzetta dello Sport report that Inter would be keen to cash in on their defender in the region of £17.5m before the end of January to avoid him leaving on a free.
