 A Grade 1 Area Court in Dei-Dei, Abuja, Federal Capital Territory (FCT), on Wednesday ordered a 28-year-old man, Anas Ibrahim, to sweep the community central mosque for six months for accommodating thieves. Ibrahim of Zuba fruit market, Abuja, pleaded guilty to belonging to gang of thieves and begged the court for leniency. The Judge, Saminu Suleiman, ordered the convict to clean the Zuba central mosque for six months or pay a fine of N20,000. The Prosecution Counsel, Chinedu Ogada, had told the court that the convict was arrested on information received from a reliable source who reported the matter at the Zuba Police Station, Abuja, on Jan. 2. Ogada said the source revealed that the convict accommodates thieves and sells hard drugs to them and after taking the drugs they attack innocent citizens at Zuba. Ogada said that during police investigation, the convict confessed to the crime but all efforts to arrest others failed. He said that the offence contravened the provisions of Sections 30B of Penal Code.
