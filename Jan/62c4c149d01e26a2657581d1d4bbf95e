Nollywood actress, Iyabo Ojo, has said that Nigeria will bleed if citizens fail to make the right choice in the upcoming election. She said this via her Twitter handle on Thursday. The actress said that she is afraid to open her inbox messages on social media because of the depressing messages she receives. She tweeted, “People are really suffering. It’s a daily struggle these days, I’m so scared to even open my DM’s. Bcos 90% of the messages are depressing. My dear country. If Nigeria gets it wrong again in 2023, this nation will bleed.”
