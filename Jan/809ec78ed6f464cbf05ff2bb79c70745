Singer, Paul Okoye, of the Square music group, has lashed out at the Independent National Electoral Commission over the distribution of Permanent Voter Cards. INEC had last week announced an extension in the period in which Nigerians are able to collect their PVCs till January 29th. On Thursday, Okoye tweeted, “Out of the 74million youths eligible voters, 26million of them are students and they are all back in school, most of them registered during the ASUU strike…it’s 10days remaining for collection #inecnigeria, why are students still in school by now?”
