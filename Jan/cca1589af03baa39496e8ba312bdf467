  Electricity distribution companies (DisCos) in the country say customers will experience a reduction in power supply for an indefinite period. This is contained in separate statements issued on Saturday by Kano, Abuja, and Ikeja electricity distribution companies (KEDCO, AEDC, and IKEDC). According to the DisCos, the shortage of electricity supply is due to “insufficient load allocation received”. “We apologise for the current poor power supply you have been experiencing in certain parts of our network lately. This is due to the inadequate allocation received, hence the load shedding,” IKEDC said.
