 The Kogi State Government has issued a query to the paramount traditional ruler and Ohinoyi of Ebiraland, Ado Ibrahim, for failing to show up to welcome the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), to the state. Buhari, who was in the state on December 29, 2022 to inaugurate some projects including the palace of the Ohinoyi built by Governor Yahaya Bello, was received by top government officials and foremost traditional rulers but the Vice President of Kogi State council of chiefs was absent. In a letter to the prominent monarch signed by Enimola Eniola, Director of Chieftaincy Affairs, Ibrahim was accused of exhibiting deliberate attitude and actions capable of bringing “Kogi State and Ebiraland in particular to grave disrepute”.
