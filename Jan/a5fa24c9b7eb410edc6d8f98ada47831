The Lagos Zonal Command of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), on Friday, arraigned the quartet of Oladepo Babatunde, Funmilayo Oladimeji, Maclean Surulere and Ernest Uduebor before Justice R.A. Oshodi of the Special Offences Court sitting in Ikeja, Lagos, on a seven-count charge bordering on conspiracy, forgery and possession of fraudulent documents.  The EFCC Head of Media and Publicity, Wilson Uwujaren, in a statement highlighted: one of the counts reads: “Oladepo Abdulbasit Babatunde, Funmilayo Oladimeji, Maclean Frederick Surulere, Captain Ayuba Suleiman Chinoko (still at large) and Ernest Uduebor, on or about the 28th of January 2022 at Lagos, within the jurisdiction of this Honourable Court, conspired to forge several Fidelity Bank manager’s cheques purporting same to be issued by Fidelity Bank Plc in favour of So Deep Energy & Logistics Ltd.”  Another count reads: “Oladepo Abdulbasit Babatunde, Funmilayo Oladimeji, McLean Frederick Surulere, Captain Ayuba Suleiman Chinoko (still at large) and Ernest Uduebor, on or about the 28th of January 2022 at Lagos, with intent to defraud, had in your possession Fidelity Bank manager’s cheque number 0719504131 purporting same to be issued by Fidelity Bank Plc in favour of So Deep Energy and Logistics Ltd, which representation you knew was false.”  According to EFCC, the defendants pleaded “not guilty” to all the charges preferred against them. The commission said that in view of their pleas, the prosecution counsel, S.O. Daji, prayed the court for a trial date. “We also urge the court to remand the defendants at the correctional facility,” the prosecution was cited to have said. Uwujaren disclosed that Justice Oshodi adjourned to March 6 and 7, 2023 for trial and also ordered that the defendants be remanded at the correctional facility.
