  As scarcity of new naira notes continues across Nigeria, former minister of Aviation, Femi Fani-Kayode, has alleged that the governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), Godwin Emefiele, is planning to provoke an uprising in the country. The chieftain of the All Progressive Congress (APC) accused the governor to be weaponizing the apex bank and that he wants to derail the country’s democracy by provoking an uprising. In a Tweet on Tuesday, APC spokesman said, ”Emefiele has weaponised the CBN and is an enemy of democracy. The policy of cancelling old notes must be totally cancelled until AFTER the election and then done lawfully. He wants to cause a crisis, provoke a people’s uprising, derail our democracy and pave the way for an ING. “He has NO plans to release enough new naira notes any time soon. He wants to STARVE the people of cash & drive them to rage out of frustration. This is not about politics but about stoking up protest & revolution. This is subversion & destabilisation. He must be stopped & caged!”
