Christian filmmaker/actor, Mike Bamiloye, has chastised his colleagues in the movie industry for the romantic roles that they play. In a post on his Instagram page on Thursday, the veteran claimed that the make-believe romance scenes are breaking down “moral defences” of the actors and weakening their abilities to control their lust. He said, “Hear me, actors and actresses! “Dear Movie-Maker,You think you are doing great movies? You think you are making money? You think you are getting popular? “Dear Movie Actor! You have acted in many movies in Nigeria and all your achievement in life has been that. You have kissed several ladies and romanced many girls on film set, the roles you love to play in movies are roles where men have to kiss you and where you have to play love roles.
