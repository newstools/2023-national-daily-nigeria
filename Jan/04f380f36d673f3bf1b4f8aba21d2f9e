Singer, Brymo Olawale, has again issued a public apology to the Igbo for his comments regarding the possibilities of south-easterners producing a Nigerian president. Brymo had been under intense fire for stating that the Igbo are not ready to produce a Nigerian president. He also urged the region to test the waters with the vice presidential slot before aiming for the presidency. He issued an apology via his Instagram on Friday and in the early hours of Monday, he tweeted another apology saying, “Forgive my assertions that came across as bigoted spewings against the Igbo tribe, I did not mean to do harm, I am sorry!!” Meanwhile, thousands of Nigerians have signed a petition to stop the singer from winning the All Africa Music Award where he was nominated in the ‘Songwriter of the Year’ category. –
