  Presidential candidate of the APC, Bola Ahmed Tinubu, says the PDP was behind the fuel scarcity in the country. The former Lagos disclosed this during the APC campaign rally in Ogun State. He said the new Naira notes and fuel scarcity is being orchestrated by saboteurs that want to stop his victory. The PDP later fired back, saying the APC candidate was crying foul after his plan to influence the outcome of the election through slush funds fell flat on his face. Tinubu also berated the PDP for misappropriating funds meant for the development of the power sector throughout its 16 years in power. Fuel queues surfaced in many filling stations in Lagos, Abuja, Port Harcourt, and other parts of the country in the latter part of last year with many marketers selling the products above the approved pump prices. He said: “We are not the same thing as the poverty development party. They developed poverty, they met good accounts. For 16 years they did not remember our gas pipelines. “This people are  saboteurs. They issued PMS and petroleum products licenses to themselves, to their supporters, and to their sympathizers. With their monopoly, they changed the course and they started creating queues. They started blackmailing the government. We are saying PDP, enough is enough.”
