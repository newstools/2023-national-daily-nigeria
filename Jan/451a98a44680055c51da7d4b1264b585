It also sought an order compelling the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) to remove Tinubu and Shettima names from the list of eligible candidates for the election. In his ruling, Justice Ekwo declared that the PDP lacked locus standi to file the suit. “Where there is no locus standi, the court has no jurisdiction,” he stated.
