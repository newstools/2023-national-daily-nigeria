   Chelsea on Sunday gave their fans reasons to celebrate after the west London club score double victory over two London rivals in Crystal Palace and Arsenal. The Blues played host to Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge as they look to shrug off their losing form and thankfully a second-half goal from Kai Havertz finally proved enough to give Chelsea a 1-0 win over Patrick Viera’s side which helped in easing the pressure on manager Graham Potter after their recent poor run of form. Havertz was at hand to nod in a cross from Hakim Ziyech in the 65th minute following a short corner. It was only the second league win in 10 matches for the home side who remain in 10th place half-way through the season. Chelsea were on top for much of the lively if scrappy derby, but Palace kept goalkeeper Kepa busy with efforts from Tyrick Mitchell, Michael Olise and Wilfried Zaha and he was forced into a leaping save from Cheick Doucoure towards the end of the second half. And fans of the Stamford Bridge club were elated when midway through the first half Chelsea announced Ukrainian winger Mykhailo Mudryk had become their fifth signing of the January transfer window, and the 22-year-old waved to fans from the pitch at halftime, a Ukraine flag draped round his shoulders. The transfer has gone to demonstrate that Chelsea had succeeded in scoring one against another London rivals Arsenal who were heavily linked with Mudryk’s arrival at the Emirates. Meanwhile, Chelsea will hope to build on their victory on Sunday to push for the needed improvement on the table.
