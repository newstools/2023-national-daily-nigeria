Governor of Benue state, Samuel Ortom, says Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party possesses the qualities of a leader who will be a true president that will guarantee justice, equity and fairness for all Nigerians. According to Ortom, if he were not a member of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), he would have personally led Obi’s campaign across the country. The Benue governor noted that Obi will provide the leadership that Nigerians desire. “Governor Ortom strongly recommends Peter Obi to Nigerians as the man who has the capacity to effectively tackle the economic, security and other challenges facing the country,” he said in a statement signed by Terver Akase, his spokesperson.
