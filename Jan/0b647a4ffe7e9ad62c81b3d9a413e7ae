The Lagos Peoples Democratic Party governorship candidate, Abdul-Azeez Adediran aka Jandor, has claimed that the location of Television Continental station, a Lagos television station, used to be a Lagos State Polytechnic campus. He made this known during an interview on Your View, a TVC talk show. The governorship candidate asked if it is legal to convert a Lagos State government property to a privately-owned property. He said, “Where we are sitting right now, this TVC premises used to be a Lagos State Polytechnic property. Even if you tidy up everything and it is legal to sell it to yourself, is it morally right?“
