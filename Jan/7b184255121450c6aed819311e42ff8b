On Saturday, the reality TV star tweeted her PVC and said, “Collect your PVC. Nigeria will be great again” This led to a tweep, one Olatunde (OneNaijaPatriot) accusing her of lying about her age. He tweeted, “You covered your date of birth and left VIN that shows everything about you. Does this make sense to you? Anyway, I’m here to inform your that I just found out that you are 32 years of age. Don’t come here 29th Sept and claim 25 years o. Have a nice day.” Retweeting the post on Monday, Eke said, “It’s a new day to pick up your PVC, don’t miss out on exercising your right. Love you!” When a tweep in the comment section, Dynamo tackled her about her age tweeting, “But you’re close to 40 yrs old why you dey lie for us,” she responded, “I’m actually 52,” with a smiling emoji.
