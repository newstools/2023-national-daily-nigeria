  A yet-to-be-named trigger-happy police officer has reportedly shot to death his five-year-old niece in cold blood on New Year’s Eve. OAP Oladotun Ojuolape Kayode raised the alarm on Sunday via his verified Twitter page. According to him, the unfortunate incident happened on Saturday in Owerri. His tweet reads; “Trigger happy policemen. Why must you shoot in the air to celebrate? It’s despicable. A likely drunken uncle shot his niece (5 year old) on the 31st night while trying to shoot in the air. They just came back, went to celebrate the New Year at their dad’s. They lost him a year ago.

He shot in the air. The bullet pierced the girl’s stomach. They didn’t even know until later. She died. “How do you explain to yourself or to anyone that you brought your child to Nigeria but you are not taking her back. The next question is “why”. Then you would say she was killed by a policeman by mistake or what? How does that even sound? You lost your child to a trigger-happy policeman on New Year’s Eve. So tragic The police force need a total overhaul. Kilode! These innocent killings by people that are meant to protect you is very very appalling. A child with a bullet to the stomach. Very tragic” he added. At the time this report was filed, the Imo Police Command had not given a statement or confirmed the incident.
