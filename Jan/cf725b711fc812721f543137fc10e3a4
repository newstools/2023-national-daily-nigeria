The Vatican on Thursday revealed how Pope emeritus, Benedict XVI, will be buried today. In an update on its Twitter handle, the Vatican said the coffin of Pope emeritus was closed on Wednesday based on tradition. Part of the statement read, “Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI’s coffin was closed in a ritual held Wednesday evening. As per tradition, the Pope Emeritus’ pallia, coins and medals minted during his pontificate, and a ‘rogito’ summarizing the highlights of his papacy, were also placed inside the casket. “Following the Requiem Mass, Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI’s coffin will be transported through the Basilica and to the Vatican crypt for burial, in the first tomb of John Paul II. “He will be buried in the traditional triple coffin, with caskets made of cypress wood, zinc, and oak.”
