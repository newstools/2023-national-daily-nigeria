 Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State at the Peoples Democratic Pastry (PDP) campaign in Khana Local Government Area, the traditional headquarters of the Ogoni people, threatened legal suit against the PDP National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu, over perceived illegal decisions”.  Governor Wike protested the decision of the PDP National Working Committee (NWC) to suspend some protesting members and the dissolution of the PDP State Executive in Ekiti. The governor agitated that the action of Ayu is ‘vindictive, tyrannical, and would do more harm to the party’. Wike, therefore, vowed that he will take every legal means to challenge any illegal decision taken by PDP National Chairman, Ayu. Governor Wike, leading the PDP Consolidation and Continuation team of the party’s governorship candidate, Sim Fubara, in Khana LGA, appealed  for the support and votes of the people. Governor Wike told the people of Rivers State to support the PDP in the state abd sustain the projects and good governance being enjoyed in the State by voting for Sim Fubara in the governorship election.  Wike questioned the integrity and capacity of the APC governorship candidate, Tonye Cole, to govern Rivers State, saying the future of Rivers State will be jeopardised if the APC is allowed back to power. Wike declared that he would continue to fight for justice and equity in the PDP, and  would never succumb to blackmail or intimidation.
