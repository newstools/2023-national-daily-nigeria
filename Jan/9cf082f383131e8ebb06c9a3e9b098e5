 The moments of celebration have finally come to the fans at Stamford Bridge as injured Chelsea midfield machine N’Golo Kante is finally closing in on return. National Daily gathered that the Frenchman is hopeful of returning to action for the west London side by the end of next month, by which time he will have spent six months on the sidelines. Sadly, the 31-year-old midfielder has been plagued by injuries this season, making just two appearances at the very start of the campaign against Everton and Tottenham. The former Leicester City midfielder injured his hamstring late on against Spurs and after initially trying to avoid surgery he was forced to go under the knife and was consequently ruled out of the France World Cup squad in Qatar. Kante has missed 27 matches for Chelsea in all competitions so far, but is now finally closing in on a return to the pitch barring any more setbacks to the delight of the Blues fans.
