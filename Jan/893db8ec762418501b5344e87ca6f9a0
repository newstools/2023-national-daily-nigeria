The former Senior Special Assistant to President Muhammadu Buhari on Niger Delta affairs, Ita Enang, on Wednesday dismissed his expulsion from the All Progressives Congress (APC) as fake news. Enang, speaking on Arise TV on Wednesday, monitored by National Daily from Lagos, emphasised he will address the issue at a press conference to be organised to clear the air on the  ‘fake news of his expulsion from the APC’. Enang maintained that he is still a member of the APC, saying, “they will not intimidate me for defending myself in court, I am the legitimate governorship candidate of the APC for the 2023 general elections. “I am the spirit, body and soul of the APC in Akwa Ibom State and nobody has suspended me or done anything that affects my status in the party and there is no judgment that gives anybody the ticket of the party. All these actions are taken against me because I have gone to court to defend myself. “The decision was taken against me because I have taken my case to court. I am entitled by law to defend myself.” Enang cautioned that people leaving the APC in Akwa Ibom State, accusing former Governor Godswill Akpabio of being responsible for people moving away from the party. According to him, “People are leaving the APC. Why are we losing followership since Akpabio came? Why are members leaving? But I will not leave.” Enang is contesting the APC governorship ticket in Akwa Ibom State with Akanimo Udofia. The Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja, in a recent judgement upheld Udofia as the APC governorship candidate in the state. Meanwhile, the APC State Chairman, Stephen Ntukekpo, was said to have signed a letter dated 24 January 2023, addressed to the APC chairperson in Enang’s ward in Ibiono Ibom Local Government Area, conveying the expulsion Enang from the party following the litigation he filed relating to the APC governorship ticket.
