Business mogul and billionaire, Tony Elumelu, has said that his age was no barrier to him becoming the Chief Executive Officer of Standard Trust Bank and one of the youngest bank CEOs in Nigeria at the age of 34. He shared this via his Facebook account on Wednesday alongside a throwback photo of himself aged 34. Elumelu linked his accelerated success to hard work and luck adding that his successes and failures have always been his driving force. He said, “This is me – aged 34! I had just become CEO of Standard Trust Bank and one of the youngest bank CEOs in Nigeria. It was a time of fast-paced change in our industry, and reform-minded policymakers had opened up paths for consolidation and strengthening our sector. Competition was intense – but youth was not a barrier. “I owe my accelerated career and successes to two things: hard work and luck, and I know firsthand how these factors are inextricable in success. My successes – and yes failures – have always driven me to create opportunities for young people. I believe that our young have the talent and the zeal to transform our world.” Elumelu is now 59 years old.
