Jamaica’s Olympic sprinting icon, Usain Bolt has lost millions of dollars in his account with Stocks and Securities Ltd, an investment company based in Kingston. The lawyers of the track star said they are prepared to file a lawsuit if that will make it possible to recover the more than $12 million that mysteriously disappeared from Bolt’s account. According to Linton Gordon, Bolt’s lawyer, the money is missing from his account in the coffers of Stocks and Securities Limited (SSL), a Jamaican investment firm. The lawyer also provided The Associated Press with a copy of a letter sent to SSL demanding that the money must be returned. Gordon was quoted to have said that Bolt’s account, which earlier had $12.8 million, is now reflecting a balance of $12,000. Bolt is said to have had investments with SSL for over a decade. It was gathered that the account includes a part of the athlete’s retirement and life savings.
