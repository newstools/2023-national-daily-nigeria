Fifth seed Aryna Sabalenka outmuscled Donna Vekic 6-3 6-2 in a ferocious battle of big hitters on Wednesday to reach the semi-finals of the Australian Open for the first time. The 24-year-old, the only top-10 seed left in the draw, took her chances in a physical one-hour first set littered with break-points before running away with the second. Vekic had held a 5-1 career record against Sabalenka but was unable to match the level of the new, improved version of the Belarusian with 13 double-faults not helping the Croatian’s cause. Sabalenka then went on to complete the semi-final line-up after 109 minutes on Rod Laver Arena. She will face Polish surprise package Magda Linette on Thursday for a place for her first Grand Slam final appearance.  Source – NAN
