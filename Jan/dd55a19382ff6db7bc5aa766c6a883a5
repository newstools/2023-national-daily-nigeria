Award-winning Nigerian writer, Chimamanda Adichie, on Wednesday, made a case for women participation in politics. She shared her thoughts in a video which she posted on her verified Instagram page on Wednesday. The celebrated author also announced her collaboration with Women In Successful Careers to organise a non-partisan fundraiser for women contesting political positions in elections to fund their campaigns. Speaking about women in politics, Adichie said, “I think that because of the challenges women face, because of the socialisation women experience, that women are more likely to do things differently. Women are more likely to think of consensus for example, women are more likely to put their egos aside. But on the other hand, I do not think that the case for women is that they are better. I think the case for women political candidates and political representation is that women are full citizens. And if we want a more perfect democracy, then we should want better representation.”
