  Manchester United fans have been thrilled with the statement coming from their latest arrival Wout Weghorst who completed a January loan move to Old Trafford after the 30-year-old promised to give ‘everything’ to the Red Devils. The Dutch native, who featured for the Netherlands at the Qatar World Cup, had joined United on loan until the end of the season. The forward who is in the books of Burnley was on loan at Turkish side Besiktas but had requested to leave the Turkish side in order to complete a move to Manchester United. ‘I feel privileged to be joining Manchester United,’ Weghorst said. ‘I’ve played against the club in the past and it’s a fantastic feeling to now have the chance to pull on the famous red shirt. ‘I’ve seen United’s progress under Erik ten Hag this season and can’t wait to start playing my part in pushing the team towards its aims. ‘Whatever happens in the next few months, I can promise to give everything to the club for as long as I am here. ‘I thank everyone who has played a part in getting me to this stage, and now I am looking forward to meeting my new team-mates and getting involved straight away.’ Burnley signed Weghorst from Wolfsburg in 2022 but the striker struggled in the Premier League last season, scoring two goals in 20 games as the Clarets were relegated to the Championship. Manchester United have agreed to pay Burnley a loan fee of around £2.6m, although the Championship leaders will pay Besiktas £2.5m. United do not have an option or obligation to buy the Dutchman at the end of the season but are covering his wages in full until then. John Murtough, Manchester United football director, added: ‘Wout has a consistent goalscoring record across several European leagues, and his attributes will add a further dimension to our squad for the remainder of the season.
