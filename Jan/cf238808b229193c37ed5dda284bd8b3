 The Nigeria Police Force PRO, CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, has publicly defended Drambi Vandi, the trigger-happy policeman who killed a pregnant Lagos-based lawyer, Mrs Omobolanle Raheem. Speaking recently during an interview with Splash FM in Abeokuta, Ogunjobi described the killer officer as a “good and very nice man”. The Nigeria Police Force spokesperson said the trigger-happy killer-cop was under a spiritual spell. “One thing people should understand, we are in Yoruba land here now. I’m sure many elders will know what they called ‘efun, edi, arosin, asasi’ (some magical spells cast on people to make them misbehave). Whatever that happens in the physical realm is controlled by the spiritual realm. In a very long time, in history & I have spent 2 decades on this job, it is very rare to see an ASP who has put in 33 years to be the one to pull the trigger. However he is going to carry his cross,” he said.
