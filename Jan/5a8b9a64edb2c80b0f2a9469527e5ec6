Pop magazine, Rolling Stone, has unveiled a list of 200 singers that it considered greatest of all time on New Year’s Day, Sunday. The list which ranked Aretha Franklin as number one with late Aaliyah coming in at 200, failed to include veteran singer, Celine Dion and this has unleashed a flurry of reactions from social media users against the list and those who put it together. A tweep, Mimi, said, “Seriously? What is that list?” Mario said “That is ridiculous and disrespectful.” Astonished Coco Caliber tweeted, “Celine Dion not in the top 200 of greatest singers of all time??? Is it crack?” Donatella said, “Celine is literally one of the vocal trinity  this has to be a joke.” Miguel shared a video of the star belting out tune and said, “Celine Dion didn’t go that hard in ‘All By Myself’ to be disrespected like this.” Dion is known for hit singles like, ‘My heart will go on,’ ‘The power of love,’ ‘I’m alive’ etc.
