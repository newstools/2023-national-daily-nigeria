A 38-year-old man who allegedly stole his friend’s car valued at N2.6 million was on Thursday brought before a Kaduna Chief Magistrates’ Court. The defendant, Onuwa Onyema, a resident of High Cost Narayi, Kaduna, is facing a two-count charge of conspiracy and stealing. The Prosecutor, Insp. Chidi Leo, told the court that the offences were committed sometime in Oct. 28, 2022 at No 23 Lagos Road Ahmadu Bello Way, Kaduna. Leo said that one Rolland Ebuka entrusted his unregistered Toyota Camry car to the defendant who is his friend to sell for him. “The car was displayed at a public place until the defendant drove it to his house where it was reported to have been stolen. “All efforts by the complainant to retrieve his car failed and he reported the case at the police station,” the prosecutor said. The offences contravened Sections 271 of the Penal Code of Kaduna State, 2017. The defendant, however, pleaded not guilty to the charges. The Magistrate, Ibrahim Emmanuel, granted the defendant bail in the sum of N200,000 with two sureties in like sum. Emmanuel adjourned the case until Feb. 13, for hearing.
