  MTN Nigeria offered incentive shares to shareholders that participated in its share offer conducted in January last year after the company failed to grow its investment in the industry. In a circular dated January 20, 2023, and addressed to investors, the mobile telecommunication giant said the incentive shares would be allotted to shareholders on certain conditions. To qualify for the incentive shares, qualified shareholders must have held on to all or some of the offer shares acquired in January last year for a 12 months period. The document read: “The Offer for sale of 575 million ordinary shares of MTN Nigeria held by MTN International (Mauritius) Limited (the offer) was successfully completed on 31 January 2022, the date on which the Securities and Exchange commission’s (SECS) clearance of the Offer allotment was obtained.

MTN Nigeria’s decision to offer incentive shares to its shareholders is likened to compensation for last year’s performance after the firm’s share was not listed among the top-performing assets in the stock market last year. It also underperformed last year when compared to its market rival, Airtel Africa, with MTN’s shareholders’ investment growing by 18.13 percent as against the 87.05 percent Airtel shareholders recorded in their investment during the period.
