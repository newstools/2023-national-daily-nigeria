The National Drug Law Enforcement Agency has razed warehouses containing cannabis inside the Opuje Forest, Edo State. The Director, Media and Advocacy, NDLEA, Femi Babafemi, revealed this on Saturday in a statement shared on the Twitter handle of the agency. The statement revealed that massive warehouses and tents storing over 317,417 kilograms (317.4 metric tons) of the psychoactive substance were destroyed and set ablaze in a two-day operation. At least, a police impersonator, Omoruan Theophilus, 37, who parades as a Police Inspector to convey the drugs from the forests to the cities and three others: Aigberuan Jacob, 42; Ekeinde Anthony Zaza, 53, and Naomi Patience Ohiewere, 42, were arrested in connection with the drugs. NDLEA said that the Opuje community in Owan West Local Government Area, Edo State, is notorious for cannabis cultivation. The agency said that after harvest, the cartel builds warehouses inside the forest reserves and employs the services of armed youths to protect the warehouses 24/7.
