   Femi Falana, a Senior Advocate of Nigeria, says it will be a daunting task for Governor Ademola Adeleke’s lawyers to overturn the verdict of the Osun State Governorship Election Tribunal that sacked him. He stated this on Sunday during an interview on Arise TV. It would be recalled that the Osun State Governorship Election Tribunal sacked Governor Ademola Adeleke for overvoting at over 700 polling units in the Governorship election. The tribunal asked INEC to give Certificate of Returns to former Governor Gboyega Oyetola.

INEC has to be held completely responsible for what happened. “INEC will have to go back to the drawing table so that we will not have this experience. INEC will have to put its house in order, If we have this in a presidential election, where you issue one or two reports, it will have a crisis of monumental proportions,” he said. He however, urged voters in Osun State to sue the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for wasting their votes. “What the voters in those areas have to do is to sue INEC for damages that you have wasted my votes,” Mr. Falana said.
