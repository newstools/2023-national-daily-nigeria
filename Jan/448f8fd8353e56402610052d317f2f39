He declared the areas hitherto ravaged by insurgency as safe, especially, the local governments areas located in the northern part of the state, saying those communities are no more danger zones. “We had sustained regular operations across the areas identified as flash points with a view to maintaining relative peace and stability in the areas,” he said.
