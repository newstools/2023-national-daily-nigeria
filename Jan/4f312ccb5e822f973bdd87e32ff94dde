Passengers were on Monday morning, January 23, left stranded at the Murtala Mohammed International Airport (MMIA), Lagos, following an industrial action by members of the Nigerian Aviation Handling Company Plc (NAHCO). It was gathered that several international and local flights at the airport were grounded following the strike. BusinessDay reports that the protesting workers are demanding salary increment, among others. A source at NAHCO disclosed that the management had met with the staff on Sunday over the proposed strike but assured that the situation will be addressed soon. According to one of the affected passengers who spoke with Instablog9ja, “We were told that the strike affected almost all the flights in Nigeria that are working with NAHCO. They said Qatar had to go back to their base (Doha) because they can’t stay in Nigeria.”
