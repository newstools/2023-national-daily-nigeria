Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu of Lagos State has congratulated former Gboyega Oyetola of Osun State on his victory at the Osun State Election Petitions Tribunal on Friday. Oyetola lost the election at the polls on the platform of the All Progressives Congress (APC) in the July 16, 2022 election in Osun State. Sanwo-Olu, Chairman of the APC Governorship Campaign Council for the Osun Governorship Election, commended the judiciary” for doing the right thing”. Sanwo-Olu at the Lagos House, Ikeja, on Friday, urged Oyetola to dust his economic blueprint that he had started with the people of Osun State and go back to work and complete the good work that he had started. “’I think the tribunal has taken its time and you can see the outcome. It was a majority decision and I want to thank and commend them for doing the right thing. I imagine they must have been under tremendous pressure but I am sure at the end of the day, they took the right outcome. “My congratulations go to the APC family in Osun. This is a victory that has been delayed for such a long time. The judiciary has shown that it was delayed but not denied, so, I want to congratulate my brother, Governor Adegboyega Oyetola. “I want to call on everybody in Osun that APC continues to remain the party to beat, continues to remain a party of relevance in Osun State and in Nigeria as a whole,” Sanwo-Olu said.
