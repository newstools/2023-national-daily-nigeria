The Edo State Police Command on Sunday disclosed that the suspects of Igueben Train attack and abduction appeared in court for the extension of exparte order.

Gunmen stormed Igueben train station on January 6, kidnapping several    passengers waiting to board a train to Warri. A copy of pleadings signed by Barr. I. E. Ekibade on behalf of the legal section of the State Criminal Investigation and Intelligence Department (SCIID) indicated that eight suspects are in police custody.
