She, therefore, remanded Ogbonna in custody pending the filing of information against him and his arraignment. Defence counsel, Abubakar Yesufu, however, prayed the court to release the defendant based on earlier bail conditions granted him. But Tella held that she lacked the jurisdiction to entertain a case of involuntary manslaughter, hence all bail applications should be presented before the high court.
