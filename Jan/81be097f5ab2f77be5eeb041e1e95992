   Tottenham manager Antonio Conte has been under immense pressure in recent weeks following his side’s poor run of form, which has seen the north London side win just one of their last five league matches in the build-up to their victory at Craven Cottage on Monday night. And National Daily learnt that Kane has vowed to ‘repay’ Antonio Conte’s faith on him and the entire members of the squad after the former Chelsea boss held a crunch meeting with them to address the club’s form. Interestingly, Kane ended up scoring his side’s winner as they got back to winning ways with a 1-0 victory against London rivals Fulham at Craven Cottage on the night. It may however suggest that Kane and Spurs may have capitalised on the points dropped by rivals Newcastle, Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool earlier in the weekend as the race for the top four spot heightens. Meanwhile, there have been mounting speculations about the 29-year-old England captain’s future at White Hart Lane during the dismal run, particularly as his contract expires in less than 18 months’ time. However, it seemed that Conte’s crunch talk with his players before their victory in west London had produced an improved display from Spurs.
