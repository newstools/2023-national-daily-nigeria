 Manchester United forward Marcus Rashford has been in scintillating form this season, but with only 18 months to run on his deal at Old Trafford. National Daily understands that United had triggered a 12-month extension clause in Rashford’s contract at the end of last year after failing to convince the striker to sign a new long-term deal. The 25-year-old, who has 16 goals in 26 appearances for the club this season, was believed to have considered leaving the Old Trafford last season. The England forward managed just five goals all season and was dropped for key clashes against Liverpool and Manchester City. But it is understood that Erik ten Hag’s appointment has rejuvenated Rashford and the forward scored his 16th goal of the season with a winner against City on Saturday. Rashford’s representatives met with Paris Saint-Germain in August to discuss a move to the French capital and the club’s hierarchy have made no secret of their desire to sign the winger. But the Manchester Evening News say talks over a new deal at the Theatre of Dreams are progressing well and Rashford is keen to stay at the club. Rashford is likely to receive an increase on his £200,000-a-week deal but it won’t be as much as top earner David De Gea, who is in talks to reduce his salary from £375,000-a-week. United are keen to lower their wage bill following Cristiano Ronaldo’s departure.
