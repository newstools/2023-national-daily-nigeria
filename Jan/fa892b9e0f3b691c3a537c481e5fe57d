Gov. Babagana Zulum of Borno has ordered the completion of the Azare Mega Water Project in the Hawul Local Government Area of the state. The governor directed the state Ministry of Water Resources to ensure the completion of the project within two months. Zulum gave the directive while assessing the progress of the ongoing project at the site in Azare town. Tijjani Baba-Alkali, Commissioner of water resources, assured the governor that the project would be completed within the stipulated time. Baba-Alkali said that the Azare Mega Water Project, which began four months ago, has 10 middle aquifer boreholes each with a pumping capacity of nine to 10 liters per second. The project, according to him, is expected to store 560,000 liters of water to enhance its availability to the 20,000 residents of Azare and its environs. “The 560,000 liters combine a surface tank with 400,000-liter capacity and an overhead tank with 160,000-liter capacity,” he said. The commissioner noted that the project included the reticulation of primary and secondary distribution networks of over 3 km and arrays of the water point. He explained that the drilling of 6 out of 10 boreholes for the project, has been completed with four more to go. Baba-Alkali also explained the water project will be powered by a hybrid of 24,000 watts of solar capacity and a 100 KVA generator set. NAN report that at the end assessment, Zulum approved five additional boreholes with high-yielding capacity in other parts of Azare town that will not benefit from the Azare Mega Water Project.
