  The All Progressives Congress has defended its flag bearer, Bola Tinubu, over the controversial bullion van that was videoed entering his residence in 2019. On the matter of the bullion van, Tinubu had derisively dismissed it then, saying he neither owed anybody an explanation or apology over the content of the vans. Featuring on Arise TV programme on Thursday, Organising Secretary of the APC, Ayodele Adewale said the bullion van missed its way into the residence of Tinubu.

He said that such a mistake was common and it would not be the first time people would make such a mistake. He tried to buttress his point with an example of when a heavy military equipment mistakenly strode into Nigerian territory and was seized by the authorities. “That bullion van missed its way there, and it was not invited by Asiwaju or anybody. That comment was made jokingly. Reporters met with him, I was there. I was standing not too far and there were a lot of accusations. “You know Asiwaju very well. He loves cracking jokes and cracking people up most times. And he made that statement. Not that he owns it. Tinubu is currently the presidential candidate of the ruling APC, and it’s common knowledge that he had played a major role in both the 2015 edition when Buhari was first elected and 2019 for his reelection.
