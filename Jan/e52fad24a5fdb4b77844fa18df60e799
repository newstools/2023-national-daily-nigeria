   Barcelona are reportedly planning to re-sign striker Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang from Chelsea only if they offload Memphis Depay. According to Spanish journalist Gerard Romero, Barcelona are working to find out if they can afford the wages of Aubameyang if Depay leaves Camp Nou amid the ongoing January transfer window. Depay is a target for Atletico Madrid after the departure of Joao Felix to Chelsea on loan on Wednesday. Barcelona director Jordi Cryuff spoke about Depay last month and hinted that the Netherlands international was looking for a move away from Barcelona.

Cryuff said, “Why should we sell Depay in January if it’s difficult to sign new players because of Financial Fair Play? He’s always been a great professional. He can be really helpful. Free agent in June? We will see in the next few months.” Depay has seen his playing time severely limited in the ongoing season due to injuries and the form of Barcelona’s other forwards. Aubameyang, on the other hand, left Barcelona last summer to join Chelsea, having joined the Spanish giants only in January 2022. The Gabonese star is having a difficult time at Stamford Bridge.
