At the meeting, Yakubu assured Nigerians that the commission in collaboration with security agencies had increased security presence in areas prone to attacks by criminals. “In four years, 50 facilities belonging to INEC have been attacked in various parts of the country. The implication of the attacks is that we have to rebuild facilities and replace materials. The commission and security agencies have increased their presence in some of these locations. “The last attack happened on Sunday last week but because of the cooperation between the military and the electoral commission, we were able to respond and the damage was limited to just a section of the building in a local government office. “Let me give our assurance here that we will rebuild facilities and replace damaged and lost items. The elections will be held despite these attacks.”
