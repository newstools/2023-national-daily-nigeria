  The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) has said the use of cash will naturally slow by 2025 as Nigeria aspires to have a cashless and efficient electronic payment system infrastructure that facilitates financial services in all the sectors of the economy. In its Payments Vision 2025 document, the CBN noted that it intended to provide secured, reliable, and user-centric financial solutions in compliance with international standards. According to the CBN document obtained from its website, the Nigerian payment landscape has many options that have displaced cash in recent times, including electronic bill payment, mobile phone top up, and mobile and instant payments.
