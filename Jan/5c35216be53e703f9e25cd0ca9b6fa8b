   The Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu has denied meeting with Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State amid the crisis in the party. Ayu was reacting to a viral photograph of him and Wike in Port Harcourt. The PDP National Chairman said the photograph trending on social media was an old image. Wike had been aggrieved with Ayu following his refusal to step down as PDP’s National Chairman. The governor and his group, G-5 demanded Ayu’s resignation in compliance with PDP rotational policy.

In the statement issued on his behalf by his Special Adviser on Media and Communications, Simon Imobo-Tswam in Abuja, Ayu stated that the trending photo was an old one which was being circulated to make it seem he recently had a meeting with Wike. “Dr. Ayu states clearly that: 1. He never travelled to Port Harcourt and 2. He has not set eyes on Gov. Wike lately. The photograph trending on social media is an old one. The story accompanying it is, therefore, false and mischievous. “He also adds, for the purpose of factual accuracy, that he is in no way embattled. The National Chairman is, rather, enjoying the New Year Break with his family. “The general public and, especially the PDP family, is advised to ignore the story and focus on the historic task ahead of the party next month,” he said. Despite the allegations, Ayu has refused to resign, stressing that he would remain in office until his tenure expires.
