According to him, the Federal Government had put in place, new policies that would cater for the welfare of personnel of the NSCDC. Audi explained that the Corps had been settling burial benefits, entitlements, accident and group life Insurance policies to personnel as and when due. He said that upon assumption of duty as CG two years ago, backlog of salaries and arrears had been cleared with a few pending, which would soon be settled. He re-iterated the commitment of the corps towards collaborating with other security agencies in dealing with hoodlums in the language they understood in line with Presidential directive. Dr Audi commended President Muhammadu Buhari for his relentless effort towards providing relevant platforms to contain various security threats across the country.
