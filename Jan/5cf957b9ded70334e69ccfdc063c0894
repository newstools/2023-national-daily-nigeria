 A detainee being transferred to a Rikers Island jail in the United States of America bolted from a transportation bus and hid under a trailer before he was recaptured, Correction Department officials said Thursday. According to New York Daily News, the detainee fled from the bus outside the Anna M. Kross Center about 8:00 p.m. Wednesday as he was being dropped off and hid under a trailer for some period. He was however apprehended. “We take all escape attempts very seriously. Our officers acted quickly and apprehended the detainee within minutes in the secure area. This incident is under investigation,” Correction Department spokeswoman Shayla Mulzac said.
