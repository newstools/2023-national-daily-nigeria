 As part of steps to curb incidences of killings by policemen in Lagos, three-quarters of the personnel serving at the Ajah Division have been redeployed to other areas across the state. Confirming the development, the Lagos State Commissioner of Police Abiodun Alabi explained that the action is a routine movement and those affected are personnel who have spent over three years at the division. He added that those affected are deployed to go and deal with the challenges in other areas and get more experience particularly as the 2023 election is approaching. The move comes in the wake of reports of alleged extra-judicial k#llings by officers of the division. Recall that Drambi Vandi, an assistant superintendent of police attached to the Ajiwe police station, was involved in a shooting incident that led to the death of Bolanle Raheem, a lawyer.
