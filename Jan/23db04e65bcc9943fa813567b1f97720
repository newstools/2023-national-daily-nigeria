Faruku Malami Yabo, who was Nigeria’s ambassador to Jordan and Iran, and one of the party governorship aspirants in the race for the 2023 governorship ticket. While addressing a mammoth crowd at a function on Thursday in Sokoto said, “I feel relief leaving my former party to join people of like minds in moving our state forward. “This decision was not mine alone but, it became the best option for us, in retrospect of our commitment and investment in APC.
