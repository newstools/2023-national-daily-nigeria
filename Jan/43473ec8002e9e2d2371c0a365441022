The Minister of Police Affairs, Mohammed Dingyadi,  after the Federal Executive Council (FEC) meeting in Abuja on Wednesday, said that the Inspector-General of Police (IGP), Usman Baba, will not be retiring midway into the 2023 general elections, saying that the Police Act 2020 gives the IGP a four-year tenure which cannot be interrupted by retirement age. According to the Police Affairs Minister, “By the provision of the Police Act 2020, the IG is now supposed to have a kind of four-year period and Mr. President has already given him letter of appointment in that regard. “So, the issue of IG going out during this election period does not arise.” Baba was appointed the Inspector General of Police by President Muhammadu Buhari on April 6, 2021. There has been the insinuation that he will be 60 years on March 1, and therefore, due for retirement, but the minister thinks otherwise.
