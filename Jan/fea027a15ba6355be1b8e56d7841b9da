Ground Handlers of the Nigerian Aviation Handling Company (NAHCO) at the Murtala Muhammad International Airport, Lagos, on Monday commenced industrial action, obstructing flights operations at the airport. The Monday strike action was in compliance with the directive of National Union of Air Transport Employees (NUATE) in a statement last week which directed its members to withdraw services from the airport on Monday. According to the directive, “in the above regard, all NAHCO staff are hereby directed to withdraw services with effect from Monday 23, 2023. This action shall be definite until otherwise directed by the secretariats of the unions.” The management of NAHCO was said to have obtained court injunction restraining the workers from going on strike. One of the union members of the Air Transport Services Senior Staff Association of Nigeria (ATTSSSAN), was said to have protested that the strike was called by the workers, not the union. Affected airlines obstructed by the industrial action include Royal Air Maroc, and Qatar Airways. NAHCO handles check-in, boarding and ramp services for many international airlines which include Qatar Airways, Ethiopian Airlines, Air France/KLM, Delta Airlines, Virgin Atlantic, Turkish Air, including domestic airlines like Air Peace.
