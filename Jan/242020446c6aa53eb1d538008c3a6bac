The presidential candidate of the Social Democratic Party (SDP), Prince Adewole Adebayo, has enjoined Nigerians not to be despair by the evidence of failure by the administration of President Muhammadu Buhari of the All Progressives  Congress (APC) government. The SDP presidential candidate decried that President Buhari “hired an unimaginative team to head the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN),” that “create debts instead of managing the economy.” He noted that Buhari’s successor would be inheriting N77 trillion debt. The SDP candidate de-emphasised the debt liability, saying he prepares to “activate the various assets of the nation to turn around the grim situation to one of international envy.” Adebayo argued that the original sin is not managing revenue accruers for the country very well because they didn’t mandate revenue accruers due to three problems that they have created for themselves include the fact that they don’t have the competence to do an appraisal of revenue profile and capture all the revenue subheads and govern all the revenue sub-head prudently. He declared that they are tardy in administration and supervision as the result show so many leakages even within the one they captured. Adebayo asserted that they have collected campaign funding and other support from those who are benefiting from leakages and blind spots. The SDP presidential candidate declared: “So, in other to keep their friends happy with them, then, their political structures, they have created no-go areas, as a result of that, they are not able to capture enough revenue. “Because they have hired an unpatriotic and unimaginative Governor of central bank, they’re able to create debts, like a drunken sailor and turned the central bank to a casino. That is why they have all these crises.”
