 In a chat with blogger Stella Dimoko Korkus, Fancy revealed she didn’t lie about Alexx not being intimate with her in 5 years.“I did not lie, I have nothing to gain by saying Alexx & I were not intimate for the 5 years we were in a relationship. While I was loyal he constantly cheated. On the cheating allegation, she said,“I caught him cheating on me with a curvy foreign woman that offered him money for him to sleep with her. They spent the weekend in a hotel & she was so angry he couldn’t perform with her so she found out about me on Instagram & sent me screenshots of their chat exchange in which she called him names & questioned his sexuality. He apologized to me & said at least he didn’t cheat technically because he was “celibate” with her. I was even disappointed he didn’t sleep with her to be honest. It would have at least validated some things for me.“
