The Edo state police command said the gunmen who were armed with AK-47 rifles stormed the train station at about 4pm on Saturday January 7 shooting sporadically before unleashing their plans. Recall that gunmen had on March 28, 2022 attacked a moving train which headed to Kaduna from Abuja, killing some and abducting many other passengers. They released most of them, before the Nigerian government resumed operations along Abuja-Kaduna train route in December 2022. The Nigeria Railway Corporation is yet to comment on the latest development as at the time of filing this report.
