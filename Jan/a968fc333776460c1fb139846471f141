A Non-Governmental Organisation, His Care and God Knows Charity Foundation, has donated cash to over 15 widows and 60 children in Akwanga Local Government Area, Nasarawa State. The Chairman of the Foundation, Clement Emmanuel, donated the undisclosed sums of cash on behalf of the group at the First Baptist Church, Akwanga, Nasarawa, on Tuesday. Emmanuel said that the donation is meant to impact meaningfully on the lives of the widows and make the children smile during the festive season. “The group decided to offer its widow’s mite to the vulnerable in the society despite the harsh economic situation of the country. “We will continue providing succour to the less privileged and despite the prevailing economic circumstances, carry out this gesture periodically. “The true essence of the festive season is to assist the less privileged in our communities and show them love,” he said The organisation’s chairman urged well-meaning Nigerians to assist the less privileged in the country by donating food items and equipping them with skills, among other interventions. “These gestures would go a long way in reducing social vices and ensure that the vulnerable ones are not used to perpetrate negative tendencies,” he said.
