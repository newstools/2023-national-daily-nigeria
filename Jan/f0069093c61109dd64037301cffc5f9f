 A super VIP ticket for what is possibly the last duel between CR7 and Lionel Messi in Saudi Arabia has been auctioned for a mega sum of the equivalent almost 2.5 million euros. A Saudi businessman, Mushref Al-Ghamdi, has won the ticket after bidding $2.6m at a charity auction. He will meet the players, with access to their locker rooms, and take a photo with the winning team.
