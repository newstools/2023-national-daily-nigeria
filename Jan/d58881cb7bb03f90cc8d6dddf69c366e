The Lagos State Police Command has disclosed how a soldier in a commercial driving against traffic became offended when a police officer stopped the bus; the soldier, as seen in a trending video, assaulted the police officer. Other police officers sighted in the video were seen trying to separate the fight in a public place along the road. The Police Public Relations officer (PPRO) of the Lagos State Command, SP Benjamin Hundeyin, said that the army authorities have been informed of the incident. The PPRO in a tweet on his official handle wrote: SP Benjamin Hundeyin @BenHundeyin “the soldier, who was a passenger, directed the driver to drive against traffic. The policemen stopped the vehicle and the soldier took offense that the vehicle he boarded was stopped. He, therefore, decided to attack the armed policeman. The Army have been informed.”
