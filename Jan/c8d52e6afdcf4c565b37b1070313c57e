 The Head of Media of the Labour Party (LP) PCC, Diran Onifade, had raised alarm that thugs attacked the vehicle of the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, Peter Obi, after the party’s presidential campaign at the Muhammad Dikko Stadium, Katsina. He said that obi and others in the vehicle were not hurt.  Onifade had in a statement emphasised: “however, on his way to the airport, hoodlums attacked the car our candidate was riding in with heavy stones from his driver’s side, causing substantial damage to the vehicle.  “Subsequently, another set of thugs also threw stones outside the stadium which damaged several vehicles, including that of our official stage crew. “The attacks may have been premeditated at the behest of desperate politicians who had been deluding themselves with the false claim that they had the North-West locked up but are now shocked by the show of force of the Obidient movement in the region.” The LP demanded thorough investigation by security operatives. Obi at the presidential campaign in Katsina, President Muhammadu Buhari’s constituency, stated: “we want to build a Nigeria where there will be security of lives and property, nobody will be in IDP (Internally Displaced Persons’) camp, your children will be secured, your children will be in school. That is a country I want to build.” Also, Obi in a tweet on his officla twitter handle after the campaign wrote: Peter Obi @PeterObi “My Campaign train landed in Katsina today for more fruitful political engagements with the people. “Again, just like others, I am excited about the great potentials that exist in the state, and how they can contribute to the National Economy.”
