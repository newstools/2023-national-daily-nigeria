 Nollywood actress, Chioma Akpotha, has set the records straight following a call out by her US-based colleague, Georgina Onuoha. Following an attack on Chioma at her polling unit on Saturday 25 during the presidential election, Onuoha used the opportunity to revisit the past and mentioned how Chioma had told her to keep things ‘quiet’ in 2019 when she raised an alarm over reports of violence that trailed polling units. Sharing a part of Akpotha’s live video, Onuoha partly wrote, PLEASE READ THE WHOLE WRITE UP. I know many may wonder why I am posting this now or speaking about it now after four years. “Well, today’s situation was a reminder of how she mocked others privately and minimised their sufferings. But she felt the need to scream today because she was directly affected. “Don’t only show bravery or compassion or empathy only when it affects you directly.” Replying, Akpotha shared a screenshoot of the conversation she had with Georgina four years ago. She wrote, “As humans , there are a very few things we hold on to in this life…God, family and INTEGRITY ! “And that is the only reason I responded because my integrity was questioned. “This is the last public response on this issue. “My conversation from four years ago with Georgina Onuoha. “Moving on…INEC what exactly is going on? The people’s mandate or NOTHING!”
