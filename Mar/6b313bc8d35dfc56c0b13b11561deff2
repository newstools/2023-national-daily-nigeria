The funeral of the late President of the Senate in the Second Republic, Dr. Joseph Wayas, has been delayed after 14 months of his demise. The former senate president died in December 2021. The cause of the delay cannot be ascertained as no one takes responsibility. National Daily learnt that Governor Ben Ayade of Cross River State, had inaugurated a funeral committee after his death for the burial, and appointed a former Attorney-General of the Federation and Minister of Justice, Kanu Agabi, as chairman of the committee. A member of the Committee, Ntufam Ugbo, was gathered to have withdrawn for certain reasons. Ugbo was gathered to have confirmed that Governor Ayade released funds for the funeral, noting that the first Wayas, Joseph Wayas Jr, is responsible for the delay. Ugbo was cited to have said, “He cannot say he does not have an explanation to give on why the funeral is delayed. He is the first son, so he should be in charge.” Wayas Jr had attributed the delay for the burial to the funeral committee. He was said to have noted that he had minimal role to play, pointing out that the committee was set to plan for the funeral. Wayas Jr. was cited to have stated: “The funeral is not exactly in our hands but that of the funeral committee. I hear there are issues surrounding the funeral funds. And some members are said to have resigned. I cannot go back to the state governor or Federal Government now due to election issues. The governor has done well already.” The Chief Media Adviser to Governor Ayade, Christian Ita, had revealed that the governor has already released funds for the funeral. Ita was gathered to have confirmed that “the governor actually released money for the burial months ago.”
