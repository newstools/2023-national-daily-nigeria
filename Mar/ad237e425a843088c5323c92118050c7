The Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps, NSCDC, has uncovered an expansive illegal refining site at Otamiri-Etche, near Port Harcourt. Operatives of the Nigeria Security and Civil Defence Corps (NSCDC) have uncovered an illegal local refinery at Otamiri-Etche in Etche LGA of Rivers State. The NSCDC State Commandant, Michael Besong Ogar, while addressing newsmen on Thursday, March 9, 2023, said the illegal refinery was uncovered following a tip-off. â€œI must confess that this is the first time of witnessing a well-fabricated illegal refinery with such a wide range of pipes laid across the area, as you can see how big the land is, you can also imagine how unscrupulous people can be despite the continuous fight against illegal dealings in petroleum products.
