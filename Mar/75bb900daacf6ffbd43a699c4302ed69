The Managing Director of Nigerian Railway Corporation (NRC), Mr Fidet Okhiria, has explained what led to the accident involving a train and a BRT bus in Lagos on Thursday morning, March 9. The accident which occurred in Ikeja area of the state claimed the lives of six persons and injured 79 others, according to governor Babjide Sanwo-Olu. Speaking with the newsmen, Okhiria said: “According to the information I gathered at the scene of the incident, they said many cars stopped when they got to the level crossing while the Lagos State Staff Bus driver continued moving, which I don’t know why. Maybe the driver thought he could pass before the train got nearer to him. He could not pass, and then the train crushed the bus. The train was coming from Ijoko to Iddo.”
