A 46-year-old British man, Richard Spencer, has revealed how he wore make-up to hide the bruises inflicted by his wife, Sheree, during regular beatings from her. Richard shared some of the videos of abuse, which were captured on a security camera in the children’s playroom. During an interview, Richard said, “When I think about those memories, I don’t feel associated with them. It’s like they happened to someone else. I know it was me, but in my mind, I can’t understand how I could have allowed that to happen. I wore make-up to hide bruises. Abuse became the norm.” Sheree, the mother of three little girls and a senior manager at the Ministry of Justice, was facing a sentence for “the worst case of controlling and coercive behaviour,” the judge in charge of the case said. She has been sentenced to four years in prison at Hull Crown Court after pleading guilty to coercive and controlling behaviour and three counts of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.
