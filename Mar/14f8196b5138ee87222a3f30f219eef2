We look forward to the implementation of your visions for a new Nigeria as outlined in your manifesto during the campaign. “Lagos, as a microcosm of Nigeria, is a testament to your capability to transform even the most challenging of situations. Your pragmatism since the days of your governorship in Lagos will now be called to greater challenges that Nigeria portrays. “Your agenda, as outlined in your policy document, offers hope and assured future. And as we turn our attention from electioneering, Nigerians will be counting on you to bring your magic touch to bear and bring about a great improvement in the fortune of our great country. I do not doubt that you will meet the expectations of all.”
