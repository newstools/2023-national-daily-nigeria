  A constitutional lawyer and human rights activist, Mike Ozekhome SAN has said that the presidential candidate of the All Progressive Congress (APC), Asiwaju Bola Ahmed Tinubu should not have been declared the winner of the just concluded presidential election because he did not score 25% in the federal capital territory even though he had the highest votes and scored 25% in 24 states across the country. Ozekhome’s position is coming after another legal luminary, Femi Falana SAN said it is not compulsory for a presidential candidate to score 25% in the federal capital territory before he can be declared winner of the presidential election. Falana had explained few days ago that the law sees the FCT as any of the 36 states in the country.

He had earlier mentioned and gave comment about the 2023 elections. According to him the candidate will suffer a problem of legitimacy. In his word: “The elections were therefore not fair, it was not transparent, it was not genuine, it was not credible. As for the emergent president elect, he’s going to carry a very strong heavy burden of legitimacy and lack of it on his neck like an albatross. “It doesn’t require even demonstration or protest on the street to drive home this point. The issue is a moral burden on him.”
