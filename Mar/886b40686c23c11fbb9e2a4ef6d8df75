Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State at the commissioning of Chokocho-Igbodo Road in the Etche Local Government Area on Monday ridiculed former Vice President Atiku Abubakar, candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) in the February 25 election, for pulling out PDP leaders and members for protest at the Headquarters of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Abuja. Wike emphasised that he warned the PDP leadership over its insistence that northerners hold onto the presidential ticket and national chairman of the party. According to Wike, “While other people are demonstrating, I am commissioning projects. I have not gone to do demonstration; my own is to commission projects and make my people happy.”
