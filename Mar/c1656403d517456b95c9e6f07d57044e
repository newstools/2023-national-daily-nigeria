 A man identified as Tunde aka White has passed on after his sidechic, Folake, set him ablaze alongside with his girlfriend, Patience. It was gathered that the ugly incident happened on Thursday, March 2, around 5am at Anuolawapo Ajasa White House command, Lagos. A source said, “Tunde and his girlfriend, Patience, were both asleep when his sidechic who he met recently, Folake, stormed his apartment and set them ablaze. She locked them in the apartment so there was no way they could have escaped the inferno. Thereafter, when neighbors noticed smoke emanating from their apartment, they broke the door and observed that Tunde had died while Patience was laying unconscious. They were both rushed to the hospital where his girlfriend is laying between life and death.” However, a manhunt has been launched by security operatives for Folake who is on the run.
