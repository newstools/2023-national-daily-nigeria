The ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) may have commenced deliberations on restructuring the party’s leadership in the post-2023 general elections. A party source disclosed to National Daily that at a recent meeting, leaders of the party considered the victory of the party’s candidate, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, in the presidential election, and proposed an overhaul of the APC leadership for a spread in representation of all interests. According to the party source, who sought anonymity, APC leaders reflected on the structure of the hierarchy both in government and the party, pointing out that the new president, Tinubu, and vice president, Kashim Shettima, are both Muslims, and in addition that the National Chairman, Abdullahi Adamu, is also a Muslim.  He said that the party leaders are considering that they cannot have a Muslim president, Muslim vice president and Muslim national chairman,  and, therefore, proposed that the National Chairman may have to step down after the inauguration of the president and vice president in May for a Christian national chairman to avoid the party being dominated by members of one religion. He noted that the national chairman will, however, remain in the north. The power distribution in the party, our source added, is an ongoing deliberation in the party to ensure equity. He said that the APC will ensure fairness to all stakeholders both in the party, and across the country; and would be starting from its internal structure.
