Late football legend Pele’s window, Marcia Cibele Aoki is set to inherit 30% of his assets, according to his will. Cibele’s lawyer Luiz Kignel in a chat with AFP on Tuesday said the will also mentions a woman who could be Pele’s unrecognized daughter. According to Kignel, the will states that Cibele, Pele’s third & last wife, will inherit his mansion in Guaruja, a seaside resort town south of Sao Paulo. Other assets belonging to Pele, who died after battling cancer in late December at age 82, include more real estate & a stake in the Pele brand, Kignel said, adding that a complete inventory has yet to be made. The remaining 70% is reserved for Pele’s children, including an unrecognized daughter that he may have. “He indicated the possibility of the existence of another daughter, whose recognition will depend on a DNA test, which could not be carried out (on Pele)due to the pandemic & the state of his health,” Kignel said.
