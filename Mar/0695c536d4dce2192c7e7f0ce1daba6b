Justice R.I.B Adebiyi of the State High Court sitting in Ikeja, Lagos, at a resume hearing on Monday, further adjourned to March 24 for the adoption of final written addresses in relation to the no-case submissions filed by both Patrick Akpobolokemi, a former Director-General, Nigerian Maritime Administration and Safety Agency, NIMASA, and Ezekiel Bala Agaba, who are facing trial over an alleged N754.8 million fraud. EFCC Head of Media and Publicity, Wilson Uwujaren, in a statement indicated that Akpobolokemi and Agaba, alleged to have defrauded NIMASA, were initially charged alongside Governor Juan, Vincent Udoye, Ekene Nwakuche, Adegboyega Olopoenia and a company, Gama Marine Nigeria Ltd., before the charge was amended to involve only both of them. According to Uwujaren, at the day’s sitting, the prosecuting counsel, Rotimi Oyedepo, SAN, informed the court that the prosecution had done its part by responding to the final written address of the defence and that the response had been served on the defence. According to him, “We served them on the 25th of February 2023, but they informed me that they would need time to respond.” He further informed the court that both parties had also met and agreed on an adjournment. The counsel for the first defendant, W.O. Busari, and counsel for the second defendant, E.D. Onyeke, both confirmed the position. Consequently, Justice Adebiyi adjourned to Friday, March 24 for the adoption of final written addresses, with respect to the no-case submissions.
