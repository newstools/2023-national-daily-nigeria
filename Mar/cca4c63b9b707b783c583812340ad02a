The commencement of the 2023 national housing and population census, earlier slated for March 29, is likely to be affected by the postponement of the governorship and state assembly elections. This was made known by the Chairman of the National Population Commission, Nasir Kwarra, while speaking at a meeting with the resident representative of the United Nations Population Fund in Abuja. The state elections, which were earlier scheduled to hold on March 11, have now been scheduled for March 18 by the Independent National Electoral Commission. Although no specific date is fixed for the commencement of the exercise, Kwarra told reporters that he will consult with President Muhammadu Buhari for a suitable date for the national census.
