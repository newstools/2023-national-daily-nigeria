As of today, four universities are functional in Delta State. “Those criticising me because they want to be governor of this state and telling Deltans lies over the new three universities are doing so for selfish reasons. “The new three universities have done first and second intake of students of not less than 5,000 students. “The important thing is that I have brought education closer to my people. The tuition fees of these institutions are low compared to other institutions. “While Federal Government keeps students at home for eight months strike, Delta State Universities keeps graduating students while others are moving to next class”
