The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) on Thursday disclosed its intention to approach the Court of Appeal to upturn the judgement of the Federal High Court, Abuja, which mandated the commission to allow the use of temporary voter cards (TVCs) in subsequent elections. The suit was initiated by two stakeholders. The Chief Press Secretary (CPS) to the INEC Chairman, Rotimi Oyekanmi, in a statement on Thursday, narrated: “The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) has been served a copy of the judgement delivered today by the Federal High Court, Abuja Division which ordered it to allow two stakeholders to vote with their Temporary Voter’s Card (TVC) since  they don’t have permanent voter cards (PVCs). “The Commission is taking immediate steps to appeal against the judgement of the trial court.” The presiding judge, Justice Obiora Egwuatu, delivering judgement on the suit, explained that the order was made since the plaintiffs were duly registered and captured in INEC’S database. Justice Egwuatu restricted the order to the two stakeholders, pointing out that the suit was not filed in a representative capacity.
