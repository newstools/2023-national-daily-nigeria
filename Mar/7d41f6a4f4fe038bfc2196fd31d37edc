The victorious presidential candidate of the ruling All Progressives Congress (APC) in the Saturday elections, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, has appointed committees to dialogue with the presidential candidates of other parties who are dissatisfied with the result of the last election. The Chief Press Secretary to Governor Rotimi Akeredolu of Ondo State, Richard Olatunde, had in a statement indicated that a Committee of APC Elders would soon commence consultation with other presidential candidates who contested the election with Tinubu, so as to assuage their defeat and join hands together to move Nigeria forward. According to Akeredolu, “The President-elect has set up committees to meet with the gentlemen who contested in the election for us to start the healing process. “I belong to one of the committees. We are going to meet them and appeal to them so that we can work together.” Tinubu had in his acceptance speech on Wednesday declared: “Whether you are Batified or Atikulated, Obidients, Kwankwasiyya or have any other political affiliation, you voted and struggled for a better Nigeria, more hopeful nation and I thank you for your participation and dedication to our democracy. “You decided to place your trust in the democratic vision of a Nigerian founded on a shared prosperity and one nurtured by the ideas of unity, justice, peace and tolerance. “I take this opportunity to appeal to my fellow contestants to let us team up together. It is the only nation we have. It is one country and we must build together.”
