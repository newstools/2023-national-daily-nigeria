The All Progressives Congress Presidential Campaign Council on Tuesday thanked Governor Nyesom Wike of Rivers State for delivering the state to in Asiwaju Bola Tinubu of the APC in the presidential election. The Presidential Campaign Council expressed appreciation to Governor Wike for ensuring the APC victory Rivers against his party, the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) and candidate, Atiku Abubakar. However, the Tinubu-Shettima Independent Campaign Council was said to have dissociated the council from the commendation of Wike. The PCC, therefore, noted that the APC members disagreeing with the gratitude to Wike are not genuine members of the party. Despite the controversy, their position remains the same. The PCC, subsequently, promised to pay back by supporting the anointed governorship candidate of Governor Wike in the Governorship elections on Saturday.
