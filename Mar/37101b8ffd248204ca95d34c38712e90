 One Mercy Yusuf has been given a 24 year prison sentence for committing a $298,000, N40 million property fraud by a federal high court in Abuja. The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) said in a statement that Yusuf and her business, T.M Properties Limited, were charged with four counts that included forgery, using fake documents as real ones, and receiving money under false pretenses. According to the anti-graft organization, Yusuf defrauded Bacab Properties Ltd by pretending to be the beneficial owner of Plot 1721 in the Jahi District Cadastral Zone B08 of Abuja in order to obtain the sum of $298,000 and N40 million.
