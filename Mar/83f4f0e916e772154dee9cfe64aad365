 Presidential candidate of the African Action Congress (AAC) in the just concluded presidential elections, Omoyele Sowore, on Wednesday insisted that the polls which produced Bola Tinubu of the All Progressives Congress (APC) as President-elect is not credible and full of irregularities. A number of opposition parties, including the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Labour Party (LP) and New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP), had expressed displeasure over the conduct of the polls. The PDP and LP leaderships in a recent joint press conference in Abuja demanded cancellation of results from polling units marred by irregularities and violence.

INEC, according to them, jettisoned the fundamental guidelines of the election which included the electronic transmission of results from the polling units in real time. AAC later withdrew its national agent from the national collation centre in Abuja to protest the lack of credibility of the polls. Tweeting on Wednesday, Sowore said the election was rigged and could not be relied upon to declare a winner. “A rigged election cannot declare a winner just as it can’t produce loser(s)”, Sowore noted, insisting he didn’t lose in the election.
