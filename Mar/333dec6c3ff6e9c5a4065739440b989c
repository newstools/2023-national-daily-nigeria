Ajuri Ngelale, a media aide to the President, Major General Muhammadu Buhari (retd.), claimed that the attack on Ruth Efidi, the woman who went viral after returning to polling unit with plastered face, occured in the South-East. He made this known while answering questions on incidents of violence recorded during Saturday’s election in an interview on CNN. Ngelale claimed that the woman who was stabbed in the eye was attacked in the South-East where Labour Party’s Peter Obi won massively. In the interview with CNN’s Zain Asher on Wednesday, Ngelale said, “Interestingly, the woman you cited with her eyes shut, that was actually a vote that took place in the southeastern part of the country where you are from, right? That Peter Obi won.” Some tweeps have reacted to the video posted by #ZainAsher, pointing out that the woman was actually attacked in Surulere and has been paid a visit by some Lagos politicians.

She was visited by the PDP governorship candidate, Jandor, after the poll. Clearly Ajuri Ngelale wasn’t being completely truthful.” AdrianObinna1 tweeted, “Ajuri lied to you. I hope you would correct this next time so the world knows the facts. There was no violence in the South East during the elections. The major violence took place in Lagos (APC’s stronghold) and in the South South (Rivers State).” Virox-S said, “Clearly #AjuriNgelale, you made two wrong statements. The woman was attacked in the SOUTHWEST where APC is the main party and secondly the upload by the BVAS is to be done AT THE POLLING UNIT by the PO, immediately after all the necessary signatures are applied. #ZainAsher.” “#AjuriNgelale see yourself. You told a bare faced lie on international television. May you forever be known for what you are,” MamusWanogho tweeted.
