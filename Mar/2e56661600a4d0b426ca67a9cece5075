   Mahmood Yakubu, chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), says the commission has nothing to hide from the Labour Party (LP). Speaking during a meeting with the legal team of the LP on Monday, the INEC chairman said the commission would make available any document the party requests. Recall that the legal team of the party was having a meeting with officials of INEC over the request to inspect materials used for the February 25 presidential poll.

So, we need to work out the schedule so that we know when your team is going to which state and on which date so that we can easily facilitate not just the certification of documents, but also the inspection of these documents that you requested.

Whatever you are asking for will be made available to you.”
