  Tottenham on Wednesday night crashed out of the Champions League following their 1-0 aggregate defeat to AC Milan after losing 1-0 to the Serie champions in the first leg at San Siro National Daily can confirm. Antonio Conte men who needed a win in their return fixture at home to reach the quarter final instead delivered a lifeless performance as they limped to a goalless draw against a side who currently sit fifth in Serie A. And speaking after Spurs’ elimination, National Daily gathered that Richarlison slammed Conte’s tactics for the second half against AC Milan and claimed the Italian did not explain why he started the game as a substitute. ‘We’re out of the biggest club competition, but we can’t play like this needing a goal, we have to put people forward especially in the second half,’ Richarlison told TNT Sports. ‘Now there’s not much to discuss, we can’t assign blame, now we have to focus on the Premier League, we train early tomorrow and the next match is against Nottingham Forest.’ When asked about his own situation at Spurs and Conte’s decision to start him on the bench for the second leg against AC Milan, Richarlison replied: ‘I also didn’t get that. I was playing well, I was in good form, I had two wins against West Ham and Chelsea and all of a sudden he put me on the bench. ‘Against Wolves he played me for five minutes, I asked why and they didn’t tell me anything. ‘Yesterday he asked me to do a test at the training ground, he said if I did well he’d play me, and when the match came he benched me. These things are not understandable.
