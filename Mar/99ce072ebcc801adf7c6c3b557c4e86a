  A senior Advocate of Nigeria, Emeka Etiaba, has said the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, was too hasty to have declared Bola Ahmed Tinubu as president-elect. Emeka who appeared on Channels Television programme on Monday, faulted INEC’s decision, saying the commission would only have announced the winner after resolving pending complaints. He said, “The issue of the complaints of the manipulations of the results sheets, BVAS not being uploaded by party agents were also swept under the carpet. The agents and parties made so much fuss about it; they were promised that it would be looked at; indeed, Section 651 of the Electoral Act gives the commission seven days to look into those issues before making a return, but they didn’t do it.

But what they could not do before they declared the winner, I doubt if they would do it now”, he said. On March 1, the INEC Chairman, Prof Mahmood Yakubu, declared Tinubu the winner of the February 25 presidential election.
