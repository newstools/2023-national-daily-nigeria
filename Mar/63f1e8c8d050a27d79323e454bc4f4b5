Vice President Yemi Osinbajo has hailed the first female captain in the presidential air-fleet, Blessing Liman, in commemoration of International Women’s Day. He shared pictures of himself and Liman on his Instagram page late Thursday, as he shared details of the conversation they both had. Osinbajo captioned the photos, “This afternoon, I had the pleasure of being flown by Captain Blessing Liman, who shattered the glass ceiling in 2011 making history as the first female pilot in the Nigerian Air Force. “I had a conversation with Blessing in her cockpit after the flight and I am delighted to note that Blessing is now one of five female pilots in the Nigerian Air Force and one of two that fly the President and I. Blessing is now also the first female captain in the Presidential Air-fleet. “Capt. Liman and the five other female pilots are great examples of what is possible when we are intentional about providing equal opportunities for women everywhere. And all speak to “Gender Equality in Roles” – the theme for this year’s International Women’s Day. “Women make up half of our population in Nigeria, but today discriminatory practices and old thinking mean that a significant percentage of half our population, possibly the smarter half(!) is not contributing as much as they can to our national prosperity. We can change that story. Happy International Women’s day.”
