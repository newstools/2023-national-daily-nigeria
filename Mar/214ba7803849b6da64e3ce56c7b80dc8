Presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP), Atiku Abubakar, responding to questions at his first post-presidential election media briefing in Abuja, refuted insinuations of reconciliation dialogue with the winner of the Saturday presidential election, Asiwaju Bola Tinubu, saying that there is no reconciliation talks between him and Tinubu, who the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) declared winner of the election. Atiku maintained that there is no going back on the resolve to challenge the outcome of the election except the legal team advises otherwise. He asserted that he will have consultation with the PDP leadership, and, thereafter, they will consider the advice of the lawyers who are studying the reports on the election, before making a decision to challenge the result of the presidential election inÂ  court. Meanwhile, the PDP had in a statement by the National Publicity Secretary, Debo Ologunagba, declared that the party has commenced legal action to recover its stolen mandate. The PDP accused the INEC of violating the Electoral Act 2022 and the INEC Guidelines and Regulations for the conduct of the 2023 Presidential election.
