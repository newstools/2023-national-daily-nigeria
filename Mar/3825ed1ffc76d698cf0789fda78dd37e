A North Texas man, Ifeanyichukwu Festus Obi, 43, will spend the next 20 years behind bars for leading a gang of criminals that allegedly used “sweetheart sc#ms” on elderly victims across the country and sent the money to Nigeria. According to the Tarrant County District Attorney’s Office, Ifeanyichukwu, was one of four people arrested following a 17-month, multi-agency task force investigation. It is reported that he is a ringleader of the “Yahoo Boys” gang in Nigeria, that sent $1.32 million in stolen money to Africa during a two-month span in 2019. He was convicted of engaging in organized criminal activity and theft of property of more than $300,000. During court hearings, it was revealed that the group is connected to callers in Nigeria who sc#m the elderly into sending money to their online love interest.
