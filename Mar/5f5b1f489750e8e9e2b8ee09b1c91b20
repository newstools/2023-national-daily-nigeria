Aggrieved Mother of the 12-year-old student of Chrisland International School, Whitney Adeniran, who died during the school’s inter-house sports activities at the Agege Stadium, Lagos State, has called on Nigerians to pray for her. Whitney’s mother, Blessing Adeniran, in an Instagram live on Saturday asked for more prayers while thanking everyone for their support so far. She said, “I did not expect the kind of support I have gotten. But we can now say we lost Whitney out of sheer carelessness, negligence and lack of compassion and the justice she deserves she is going to get it I promise you. “Thank you very much for all the prayers and all the calls. God bless you all immensely. “I just want to beg for something, my name is Blessing Adeniran. If you are praying, please include my name, please help me mention it to God. God please take care of Blessing Adeniran and her family and fight for them, that’s all I need for now.”
