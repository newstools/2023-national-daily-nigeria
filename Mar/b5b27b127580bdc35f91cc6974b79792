 Police operatives in Abuja have arrested a suspected kidnapper identified as Gideon Zamani for allegedly trying to abduct a 37-year-old mom of two. The suspect was arrested on , March 5th, 2023 after he tried to abduct the lady, identified as Tehilla Shadrach, at a fuel station in Airport Express road. According to a source, “I stepped out of the car to make a transfer for the fuel we bought, leaving my sister alone in the car. She was in the front seat at the passenger side when the guy attacked her & tried to strangle her. It happened within a space of two minutes. I think he was monitoring our movement because he launched an attack as soon as I stepped out. It was my sister’s cry for help that drew my attention. When I rushed back to the car & started beating him, the guy claimed that he’s my sister’s husband. People even believed him & started beating me until my sister was able to speak out that I’m her brother and the guy tried to kidnap her.
