Some policemen have expressed dissatisfaction with the non-payment of their allowances for work done during the February 25 Presidential and National Assembly polls. The officers who spoke to our correspondent said the promise they received was that they would be paid before the poll but were surprised that up till now they have not been paid. They also threatened to boycott the March 11 governorship and state house of assembly elections. The officers said they used their own funds throughout the election expecting that they would be refunded. “Nigerian police officers are suffering in terms of salaries. Imagine, after working diligently for the elections, police are entitled to collect N150,000 for election allowances but we didn’t get any money,” a female Superintendent of Police told the publication on Friday.
