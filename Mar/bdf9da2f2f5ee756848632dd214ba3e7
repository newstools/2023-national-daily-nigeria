  A social activist, Reno Omokri said the Labour Party presidential candidate, Peter Obi, had no path to victory because he lacked national spread. Omokri said the presidential candidate of the All Progressives Congress (APC) Bola Tinubu, who was aware of that fact, used his trusted business partners to deceive Obi into joining the presidential race. According to him, the president-elect did that to reduce the votes of the Peoples Democratic Party, which came second in the election. Omokri spoke further that Tinubu displayed mastery in understanding the mentality of the Obidients, who he said lacked the humility to see that they were being played.
