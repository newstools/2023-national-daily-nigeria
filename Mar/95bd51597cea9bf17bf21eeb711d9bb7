A three-member panel of the Court of Appeal led by Justice Mohammed Shuaibu, after taking the argument and adopting the briefs of all parties on Monday,  in the appeal by Governor Ademola Adeleke of Osun State challenging the annulment of his election, reserved judgement on the decision of the governorship petition tribunal which nullified the Osun governorship election won by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). Counsel to Adeleke, Onyechi Ikpeazu, at the proceeding held that a member of the panel, who is also a chief magistrate, did not express her opinion during the Judgement delivery. Rather, she only appended her signature and the constitution mandates her to have expressed her views about the suit. Counsel to Oyetola, Lateef Fagbemi. argued that mere signing of the judgment, and not making any comment afterwards does not make the judgment invalid. The counsel stated that the case of over voting exceeded 6 polling units as claimed by the Appellant, saying that the anomaly was experienced in 744 polling units across the state. Adeleke of the Peoples Democratic Party had won the  July 16, 2022 governorship election in Osun but the result was annulled by the Osun Governorship Election Petition Tribunal, citing over-voting.
