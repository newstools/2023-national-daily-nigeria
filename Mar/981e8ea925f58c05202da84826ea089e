  The Kogi State Government on Friday ordered the arrest and prosecution of individuals and businesses rejecting the old naira notes. A statement by Commissioner for Information, Kingsley Fanwo congratulated Nigerians on the “historic ruling of the Supreme Court”. The apex court last week ruled that both the old and new naira notes remain legal tenders until December 31, 2023. Fanwo explained that the Yahaya Bello administration joined other states to pursue the case to ease the hardship occasioned by the unavailability of cash.

Also, banks that refuse to accept old naira deposits shall be sealed.” Fanwo warned that the government will not accommodate financial institutions “that willfully disobey court orders, moreso, the orders of the highest court in Nigeria”. “Since the banks are issuing the old naira notes, they are bound to also receive it. We cannot continue to kill our economy after the Supreme Court has granted us freedom.” The statement announced the establishment of a high-powered committee to ensure full adherence and compliance to the verdict.
