The National Chairman of the Labour, Julius Abure, on Tuesday dismissed insinuations of having alliance with any party for the governorship and state assemblies’ elections on Saturday. Abure in a statement on Tuesday, directed the “millions of the electorate who believe in LP presidential candidate, Peter Obi” – the ‘Obidients’, to vote Labour Party’s candidates in the governorship and state assemblies’ elections. Abure, in the statement, declared: “this call becomes necessary given reports from some political opportunists from other political platforms, claiming that they have reached an agreement with Obidients and LP supporters to cast their ballots for them in this Saturday’s polls. “We want to state categorically and unequivocally that the national secretariat of LP has not given any instructions for any chapter of the party to liaise or support any candidate except LP candidates in this Saturday’s polls. “Our members should not only go out and vote, but follow the process to a conclusive end as provided by the Law. “We encourage millions of the electorate who believe in LP presidential candidate, Mr Peter Obi and the philosophy of the party not to be deterred, but troop out en masse and vote for all LP candidates anywhere in the country. The LP is not in any alliance with any political party in the run-up to this Saturday’s polls.” Labour Party (LP) had won 12 states and the FCT in the February 25 presidential election and aspires to consolidate on that performance to win the governorship election in some states on Saturday.
