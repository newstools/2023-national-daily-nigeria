   The Presidential Election Petition Court (PEPC) has scheduled ruling for 2pm on Wednesday on the motions by the President-elect, Bola Tinubu and his party, the All Progressives Congress (APC) for leave to inspect materials used by the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) for last presidential election. A three-member panel, presided over by Justice Joseph Ikyegh, chose the date and time after lawyers to Tinubu and APC – Akintola Makinde and Omosanya Popoola – moved the four ex-parte motions they filed. Mr Peter Obi, the presidential candidate of the Labour Party, LP, on Friday obtained permission from the Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja to access all sensitive materials used by the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, for the conduct of the presidential election on February 25. The appellate court, which will sit as the Presidential Election Petition Tribunal, also ordered the electoral body to grant access to the election materials to the presidential candidate of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP.
