Comedian Chris Rock’s jokes about actor Will Smith have reportedly been edited out of his Netflix special after a live broadcast. Chris had used the live show to break the silence on being slapped by the actor at the Academy Awards in March 2022 while issuing a series of stinging rebukes at Will and his wife Jada Pinkett-Smith. Will is reportedly “embarrassed and hurt” by Chris’ decision to base his Netflix special on their clash. However, Chris got the title of Will’s film wrong and had to correct himself before admitting to the crowd he’d blundered the joke. He said, “Years ago, his wife said I should quit the Oscars. I shouldn’t host ’cause her man didn’t get nominated for Emancipation. “The biggest piece of s*t ever. Okay, so the n** r gives me a f*ing concussion. No, not Emancipation, I f***d up the joke. Concussion.” Fans were quick to notice that when the special is watched now, Chris’ joke is delivered with the right film title, and his apology for messing it up has been removed.
