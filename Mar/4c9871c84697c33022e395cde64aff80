The website of the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency has crashed amid the commencement of its recruitment. Checks by our correspondent on Monday found that the agency’s website indicated ‘500 internal server errors’. The agency’s recruitment application began on Sunday and was expected to last for two weeks. However, for hours now, applicants cannot access the website. The Director of Media and Advocacy of the agency, Femi Babafemi, confirmed the development but explained that it was due to glitches resulting from traffic on the website. “The portal never crashed. There are glitches due to the huge number of applicants trying to access the platform simultaneously, but our technical team is resolving that before noon,” he stated.
