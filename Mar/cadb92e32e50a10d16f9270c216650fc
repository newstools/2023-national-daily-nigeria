  Ten days after it was delivered, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on Monday evening complied with the Supreme Court’s ruling on the old naira notes. The apex court had on March 3 extended the validity of the old N500 and N1000 notes till December 31. However, the silence of the CBN on the ruling unsettled Nigerians after traders and other business owners refused to accept the old banknotes as means of transaction. The development forced the Kogi and Ekiti States to threaten individuals and businesses rejecting the old naira notes with arrest and prosecution last week. Some state governments had given CBN till Tuesday to obey the Supreme Court’s order or face contempt proceedings.
