  Manchester United were on Sunday eviscerated by Liverpool after Jurgen Klopp’s men handed the Red Devils their historic 7-0 defeat at Anfield. National Daily can confirm that Cody Gakpo, Darwin Nunez and Mohamed Salah’s respective braces and a goal from Roberto Firmino were enough to condemn United to their heaviest defeat in Premier League history. Though they fared well in the first-half, the Red Devils were completely and utterly hopeless after the break, while Rashford, arguably one of the best players in the world right now, could hardly get into the game. In 14 games against Liverpool, the 25-year-old has scored six goals but all of them have come at Old Trafford, and at Anfield he failed to to find his clinical touch, missing two great chances to find the back of the net. Erik ten Hag and his players stated their disgust at their own performance following the match and National Daily learnt that their in-form forward Rashford has now broken his silence. The forward adding his own assessment has urged Manchester United fans and players alike to ‘trust the process’ after their latest humiliation. ‘I wish we could play a game today to try and put things right,’ the England international posted on Twitter on Monday. ‘The result is the result, and we can’t see past that! ‘We must not let it define our season. We have to trust the process and stick together.’ Prior to this result, United had lost just one of their last 22 games – an away defeat to league leaders Arsenal – and just last Sunday had won their first trophy under Ten Hag by beating Newcastle in the Carabao Cup final. National Daily understands that Ten Hag’s arrival has transformed the club this season and revitalised Rashford who has scored 25 and recorded nine assists so far this campaign. He and the rest of the team will hope to be back to winning ways in their next match on Thursday, when they host Real Betis in the Europa League.
