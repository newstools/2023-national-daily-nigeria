 The Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in Jigawa says it is set to use the election rescheduled period to organise refresher training for ad hoc staff in the state. The INEC Resident Electoral Commissioner (REC), Prof. Muhammad Bashar, said this when fielding questions from newsmen in Dutse on Friday. Bashar said the decision of the electoral body to shift the elections forward would enable the commission to retrain ad hoc staff for better service delivery. He added that “the commission had taken note of challenges encountered during the Presidential and National Assembly elections, hence its decision to retrain staff to correct the mistakes. “Even though we’ve trained them earlier, it is another opportunity to do more.” The REC said that the commission had received all materials for the governorship and state assembly elections in the state. He added that election materials, both sensitive and non-sensetive, have been sorted out and allocated, “and now under the supervision of party agents and INEC staff at Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). When asked about the safety of the materials, Bashar said “the materials are in the custody of the CBN, as we speak now, they are there in their warehouse, we did not take them to LGAs yet.’’ The REC further said that the commission had so far received 20 petitions and complaints from both political parties and candidates in the state. He added that it also received applications for the issuance of certified true copy of ballot papers and result sheets. “I cannot tell you the exact number of petitions, I would tell you about 20 so far received from diverse areas of the state and from different political parties.
