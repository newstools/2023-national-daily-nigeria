The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) had in October announced the redesign of the N200, N500 and N1000 notes last October and the new notes were released in mid-December. People were initially given until the end of January to hand in all their old notes, although this had previously been extended amid the chaotic scenes. But the shortage of the new notes had created a crisis for the banks as many customers attacked bank branches across the country forcing many of them to shut down operations.
