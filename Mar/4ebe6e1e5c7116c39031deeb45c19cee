Militants were reported to have ambushed the Cameroonian military, the Rapid d’intervention Battalion (BIR), in Atabong East, a community in Idabato subdivision, at the weekend while they were carrying out military operations in communities in Isangele and Idabato subdivisions, killing 5 soldiers. It was gathered that there was exchange of gunfire between the militants and the Cameroonian army in Abana during a kidnap attempt on foreign visitors. One of the militants was said to be killed in the confrontation. The National Leader of the Biafra Nations League (BNL), Princewill Chimezie Richards, was said to be in the territory when the Cameroonian military invaded.  Richards had posted on his facebook that he would be visiting Bakassi Peninsula on the day of the incident. National Daily gathered that the BNL has been demanding stoppage of horizontal drilling of oil in Bakassi by government except the government makes agreement with Biafran separatist agitators, who are claiming that the Bakassi Peninsula is part of Biafran territory. Meanwhile, no group has claimed responsibility for the ambush of the Cameroonian army.
