The Nigeria Police on Saturday debunked reports that officers deployed on election duties are yet to be paid, saying that the Force has paid all allowances of police officers deployed for the presidential and National Assembly elections. The Force Public Relations Officer, Force Headquarters, Abuja, CSP Olumuyiwa Adejobi, in a statement on Saturday, noted that reports that the Force has not paid officers that went on election duties was astonishing. He declared that such delay has not gone down well with the Force. The FPRO declared: “The Nigeria Police Force wishes to clear the air on the alleged non-payment of elections allowances to police personnel who participated in the elections held on Saturday, 25th February 2023. “The Force wishes to confirm in strong terms that it has paid all its personnel the election allowances as the mandate for the payment of the allowances due to all Police Officers has been issued and all lodgements have been made to respective Deposit Money Banks (DMBs) for onward payment to Police Officers banking with them. “It is pertinent to reaffirm that issues of non-payment should not be ascribed to the Force as the Police Account and Budget Office has done the needful and preparations are underway to pay the second tranche of election allowances for the Gubernatorial and State Houses of Assembly elections next week. “We are not unaware of the antics of some mischief makers peddling false publications through their paid bloggers hellbent on dragging the Force in the mud for flimsy issues.”
