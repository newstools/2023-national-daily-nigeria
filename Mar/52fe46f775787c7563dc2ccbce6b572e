He shared pictures from the meeting via his Twitter handle on Saturday and said, “Yesterday, I shared great moments with all the candidates of our great party, LP, in Anambra State, both at the Federal and State level. I reminded them that at the centre of our campaign will be a strong desire for service to the people and a firm commitment to nation-building. “We must build a better nation for ourselves and for future generations. Once again, I congratulated our candidates who won various elective posts at the federal level, and encouraged those contesting at the state level to give in their best. “I listened to their challenges and wished them well. They shall succeed. A New Nigeria is here.”
