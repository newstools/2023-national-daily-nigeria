Edwin Sakala was arrested in March 2019 after residents exposed him for having carnal knowledge of a mentally ill woman in Masala. Eyewitnesses had revealed that the man, who was 29 years at the time, used to drag the woman into his apartment every night to have sex with her and then bring her out early in the morning.
