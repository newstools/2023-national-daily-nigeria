   The Nigerian Bar Association (NBA) has asked President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately direct compliance with the terms of the order by the Supreme Court in its judgement delivered on 3 March 2023 in respect of the naira redesign policy. The NBA’s position is contained in a statement on Monday by its President, Yakubu Maikyau (SAN). Part of the statement reads: “Nigerians may not be too enchanted with our Judiciary, and this may have arisen from unsubstantiated and spurious allegations of judicial misconduct, the fact however remains that we still must look to the Judiciary as the only and final resort, to protect our rights as a people and secure probity in public life.

Our system of democratic governance has come to stay, it must not only be respected by all and sundry but must also be jealously guarded and protected. “This is the greatest test or challenge to our constitutional democracy and the Executive cannot afford to disregard the orders of the Supreme Court made for the benefit of the people that elected it to power. “I therefore on behalf of all Nigerians, call on the President to immediately direct compliance with the terms of the orders made by the Supreme Court in its judgment delivered on 3 March 2023.”
