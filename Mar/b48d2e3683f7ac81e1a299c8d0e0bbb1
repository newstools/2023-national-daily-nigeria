  The US ambassador to Nigeria, Mary Beth Leonard, has admitted the presidential election conducted on February 25 didn’t meet the expectations of Nigerians. Leonard, in an op-ed, “The Elections of February 25,” noted that many citizens are not happy with the results of the polls. She, however, acknowledged that others are celebrating victories they believe were hard-fought and well-earned. Leonard has now called on the Independent National Electoral Commission, INEC, to promptly address the challenges ahead of the March 11 gubernatorial and House of Assembly elections.

Bola Tinubu of the ruling All Progressives Congress, APC, was declared the winner. But Atiku Abubakar of the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP, and Peter Obi of the Labour Party, LP, are heading to court. Leonard added: “In the coming days, it will be important for the future of this country that Nigerians not let their differences divide them, and that the legally established process for resolving challenges to the election be allowed to take its course.”
