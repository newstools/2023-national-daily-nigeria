Thousands of Twitter users were unable to access the social media platform on Wednesday, and had reported to the Downdetector outage monitoring website. Downdetector tracks outages by collating status reports from a series of sources, including user-submitted errors on its platform. Checks by our correspondent on Wednesday as at 11 am showed that 3,473 Twitter users had already reported the outages on Downdetector. The outage seems to be primarily affecting the app, while some users have reported issues with the website as well. The unexplained collapse follows Elon Muskâ€™s latest round of layoffs this week where he fired around 200 product managers, data scientists, and engineers responsible for site reliability.
