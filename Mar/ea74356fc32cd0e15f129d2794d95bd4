 A team of navy officers have been captured assaulting police officers at a police station in Delta State. It was gathered that the incident occurred at the Enerhen police station in Warri area of the state, on Friday, March 10, 2023. Although, itâ€™s unclear why the navy officers stormed the station to attack the police, reports indicate that it has to do with money. In the video obtained, police officers were begging their colleague, identified simply as Kingsley, not to take laws into his hands after he was beaten and injured on the face. One of the police officers, who was recording the video, also threatened to use his teargas on the navy officers.
